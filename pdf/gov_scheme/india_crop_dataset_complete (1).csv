For dwarf high yielding varieties, give pre sowing irrigation. For heavy soils, four to six irrigations are required whereas for light soils 6-8 irrigations are necessary. Under limited water supply apply irrigation only at critical stage. When water is available for only one irrigation, then apply at crown root initiation stage. When two irrigations are available then apply at crown root initiation and flowering stage. Where three irrigations are possible, 1st irrigation should be given at CRI stage and 2nd at late jointing (boot) and 3rd at milking stage. CRI stage is most important stage for irrigation. It has been found that each week delay in 1st irrigation from CRI stage results in yield reduction of 83-125kg per acre.First irrigation should be given 20-25 days after sowing. This is crown root initiation stage and moisture stress at this stage will lead to yield loss. At tillering stage within 40-45 days after sowing, apply second irrigation. Third irrigation within 60-65 DAS at late jointing stage. At flowering stage (within 80-85 days) give fourth irrigation. Fifth irrigation at dough stage (within 100-105 DAS).","Insect Pests And Their ControlAphids:These are nearly transparent, soft-bodied sucking insects.

To avoid loss in yield crop should be harvested before it is dead ripe. Timely harvesting is needed for optimum quality and consumer acceptance. The right stage for harvesting is when moisture in grain reaches to 25-30%. For manual harvesting use serrate edge sickles. Combines harvester are also available which can do harvesting, threshing and winnowing of wheat crop in single operation.","After manual harvesting, dried crops for three to four days on threshing floor so that moisture content of grain comes down to 10-12% and then threshing is done by trampling bullocks or thresher attached to bullocks. Direct sun drying and excessive drying should be avoided and the grains should be packed in sound clean gunny bags to minimize the losses. The Hapur tekka is a cylindrical rubberized cloth structure supported by bamboo poles on a metal tube base, and has a small hole in the bottom through which grain can be removed. Large scale grain storage is done in CAP (Cover and Plinth) and silos. To keep away several pest and disease during storage, use 1% malathion solution for disinfection of gunny bags. Properly clean the storage house, remove the cracks and fill the rat burrows with cement. White wash the storage house before storing grains and spray Malathion 50 EC @ 3 Ltr/100 Sq. meters.

For Management of Mealybug, sow Bajra, Arhar, Maize and Jowar in the fields surrounding cotton crop. Avoid growing tur, moong and bhendi in and around cotton field as these harbour insect pests. In Punjab cotton wheat rotation is common but rotation with berseem and clusterbean has been found to have beneficial effect on the succeeding cotton crop.SpacingFor American cotton use spacing of 75x15 cm under irrigated condition while under rain fed condition use spacing of 60x30 cm. For desi cotton use spacing of 60x30 cm for rain fed as well as for irrigated condition.Sowing DepthSowing should be done at depth of 5 cm.Method of sowingFor sowing use seed drill for desi cotton while dibbling of seed is done in case of hybrids and Bt cotton. Square planting is beneficial compared to rectangular planting. Few gaps arise due to failure of seed germination and mortality of seedling. To overcome this gap filling is necessary. Two weeks after sowing the weak/diseased/damaged seedlings should be removed by keeping a healthy seedling/hill.","Seed RateSeed rate varies with variety, growing zones, irrigation etc. Use seed rate for American cotton hybrid@1.5 Kg/acre while for American cotton variety use seed rate of 3.5 kg/acre. For desi cotton hybrid@1.25 kg/acre and 3 kg/acre for desi cotton varieties.Seed TreatmentSeed of cotton is covered by short fibre in American cotton. Before sowing removal of this necessary as it will make difficulty for sowing. It can be removed by chemical and Non-chemical method.In Non-chemical method, seeds are soaked in water overnight, then next day rubbed with cowdung and wood ash or saw dust then dried in shed before sowing.In chemical method, Depending upon the fibres on the seeds, mix the 400 gm concentrated Sulphuric acid (Industrial grade) in per 4 kg seeds for American cotton and 300 gm for 3 kg Desi cotton seed for 2-3 minutes. It will burn all the fibers of seeds. Then 10 Ltr of water in container, stir well and drained out the water.

Avoid picking of wet bolls, pick cotton free from dry leaves trash. Damaged boll should be picked separately and discarded for seed purpose. The first and last picking are usually of low quality and should not be mixed with rest of the produce to fetch better price. Pick boll should be clean and dry to get good price. Do picking when there is no dew. Picking should be regularly done after every 7-8 days to avoid losses incurred due to fall of the cotton on ground. Delay in picking leads to falling of cotton on the ground which results in deterioration of quality. Harvest the American cotton at the interval of 15-20days and Desi cotton at 8-10 days interval. The picked kapas should be properly cleaned before taking to the market for sale.","Cotton is one of the most important fibre and cash crop of India as well as of entire world.

Give a third ploughing if necessary for rainfed crop, in the end of June or early July. Use harrow or tillers for cultivation purpose. When land is heavily infested with perennial weeds, very deep ploughing is needed. For irrigated crop, make beds of convenient size depending upon topography. Nature of irrigation source etc. Application of 5-7 ton/acre of chicken manure or 10 ton/acre of farm yard manure or well decomposed cow dung should be done 1 month before sowing. It helps to improve soil structure along with good plant growth.","Time of sowingSow the rainfed crop with the advent of monsoon in the last week of June or in the Ist week of July. Complete sowing as early as possible as delay sowing results in reduction in yield. Where irrigation facility is available sow kharif groundnut from April end to May end.SpacingSpacing to be adopted is depends upon type of variety. i.e., for semi spreading variety (M 522) use spacing of 30cm between the rows and 22.5 cm between plants and for bunchy type varieties (SG 99, SG84) use spacing of 30x15 cm.Sowing DepthHealthy and well developed pods should be hand shelled with a suitable groundnut sheer about fornight before sowing. Pods are sown with help of seed drill at depth of 8-10 cm at a seed rate of 38-40 kg/acre.Method of sowingseeds are sown with help of seed drill.ICRISAT method:Polythene mulching has been attributed as one of the major improved cultivation practices for enhanced productivity of groundnut in China. When grown under polythene mulch system, groundnut matures about 10 days earlier than under non-mulched condition. Polythene mulching increases the soil temperature by retaining the heat from the sun. The increased accumulated temperature shortens the crop period. During the hot season it also protects the soil from direct sunlight.In this technology, Broad beds and furrows are used for groundnut cultivation. Environment of Broad beds and furrows system is favourable for the development of groundnut pods, by doing little modification in the size, beds are formed along with polyethylene film mulched. Make beds of 60 cm width and leave 15 cm on the either side for the furrows. In a plot size of 4.5 m x 6.0 m, five beds can be made. After the formation of the bed and fertilizer application, spread black polythene sheet (90 cm width) over the soil surface. Polyethylene sheet of Seven micron @20kg/acre is required. Holes can be made at required spacing of 30 x10 cm before spreading of the sheets. The seed requirement is similar to normal groundnut cultivation","Seeds RateFor sowing use seed rate of 38-40kg/acre.Seed TreatmentUse healthy and well developed kernels for sowing. Discard very small, shrivelled and diseased kernels. Carry out seed treatment with Thiram@5gm or Captan@2-3 gm/kg or Mancozeb@4g/kg or Carboxin or Carbendazim@2gm/kg of the kernels to avoid infestation from ground borne disease. After chemical treatment, treat the seeds with Trichoderma viride@4g/kg seed or Pseudomonas fluorescens@10gm/kg seed.

Apply first irrigation at flowering stage. If the Kharif crop is caught in a long spell of draught, especially at the pod formation stage, supplemental irrigation is given, if water is available (In pod development stage, 2 - 3 irrigations are given depending on the soil type). Another irrigation a few days before the harvest may be given for full recovery for pods from soil. | To improve pod filling spraying of nutrient solution is important.

36,Sugar And Starch Crops,Sugarcane,"Sugarcane, Saccharum officinarum L. is a perennial gras. It belongs to bamboo family and it is indigenous to India. It is the main source of sugar, jaggery and khandsari. About two-thirds of the total sugarcane produced in India is consumed for making jaggery and khandsari and only one third of it goes to sugar factories. It also provides raw material for manufacturing alcohol. Brazil is largest producer of sugarcane followed by India, China, Thailand, Pakistan and Mexico. In India, Maharashtra is largest producer of sugar and it contributes about 34% of sugar in country followed by Uttar Pradesh. | 1) Mechanical Measure:As sugarcane is widely space crop, weeding with hand or interculture operation can be easily carried out. Take 3-4 hoeing after every irrigation. 2) Cultural Operations:It included change in cropping pattern, intercropping and trash mulching. Monocropping leads to heavy infestation of weed. Crop rotation with fodder or green manure crops suppress weeds. Also sugarcane is wider space crop so there is opportunity for weed to grow in large numbers. If sugarcane is intercrop with short duration crops then it will suppress the weed growth also give additional benefit. In trash mulching, mulch of 10-12cm thickness is provided in between cane row after emergence of cane. It will restrict the sunlight thus help to check weed growth. It also conserved soil moisture. 3) Chemical:To control weeds, carry out pre-emergence weedicide application with Simazine or Atrazine@600-800 g/acre or Metribuzine@ 800 g/acre or Diuron@1- 1.2 kg/acre. Apply pre-emergence herbicides immediately after planting.

First ploughing should be given at depth of 20-25 cm. Crush clods with suitable implements or machine.,"Time of sowingIn Punjab, planting season of sugarcane is from September to October and February to March. Sugarcane takes generally one year to mature therefore called as Eksali.SpacingRow spacing is ranges from 60-120 cm for sub-tropical regions.Sowing DepthSow the sugarcane at depth of 3-4 cm and cover it with soil.Method of sowingA) For sowing use improved method of planting like deep furrow, trench method, paired row method or ring pit method.1) Dry planting in ridges and furrow:With the help of tractor drawn ridger, make ridges and furrows at distance of 90 cm. Plant sugarcane setts then cover it with soil. After then give light irrigation.2) Paired row planting: Make Trenches at 150 cm distance using trenches opener. Plant sugarcane in paired row using 30:30-90-30:30cm spacing. It gives higher yield as compared to ridges and furrow.3) Ring Pit method:Circular pits of 60 cm diameters are dug at depth of 30 cm with a tractor mounted digger. 60 cm gap is provided between adjacent pits. 2-3 ratoons can be taken. 25-50% higher yield can be obtained compared to ridge and furrow.B) Single budded set planting: Select healthy setts for plantation. Make furrows at distance of 75-90 cm. Place single budded setts. If only small size setts from top portion of cane are selected then they are planted at distance of 6""-9"". Place eye of sett on upward direction to ensure proper and quick germination. Cover setts with soil and apply light irrigation. | 1) Mechanical Measure:As sugarcane is widely space crop, weeding with hand or interculture operation can be easily carried out.

Germination percentage of single bud sett is very low because of moisture loss from other cut end. Also if whole can stalk is planted without giving any cut, still germination percentage remain low as only top end will get germinate.Seed rate vary from region to region. In North West India, seed rate is high because of low germination percentage and adverse weather i.e hot weather with desiccating winds. Use seed rate of 20,000 three budded setts per acre.Seed TreatmentTake seed material from crop of 6-7 months age. It should be free from pest and disease. Discard pest, disease affected and damaged buds and canes. Harvest seed crop one day before planting, it will give high and uniform germination. The setts should be soaked in Carbendazim@3gm in 1litre of water. After chemical treatment treat with Azospirillum. For that dip setts in Azospirillum inoculum@800gm/acre +sufficient water solution for 15min before planting.Soil TreatmentSuspended 5 kg of bio fertilizer per acre in 10 litres of water & mixed with thoroughly with 80-100 kg of FYM.
