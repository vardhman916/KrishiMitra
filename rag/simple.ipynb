Non-violence, non-absolutistic \\nviewpoint (Anekäntaväda), and non -possessiveness/ non -attachment (Aparigraha) are fundamental \\nprinciples of Jainism. Non-violence strengthens the proper conduct of every individual, non -absolutistic \\nview stre ngthen the right thinking of every individual, and non -possessiveness strengthens the \\ninterdependence of all existence and provides harmony in society. If we observe these three principles \\nin their true spirit, peace and harmony can certainly be attained within us as well as in the world. \\nAlthough not fully introduced to the western world, Jainism is India’s oldest living religion. The basic \\nprinciples of Jainism are scientific and the ‘truths’ presented in the Jain scriptures are universal; however, \\ntheir interpretations and applications have to be done in the context of time and space in which we find \\nourselves. \\nIn English-speaking countries where many Jains have settled permanently such as USA, Canada, UK, \\nand Africa, children do not have access to Jain educational material. In an attempt to make Jain principles \\nknown globally, the educational material must be made widely available in English. It is also necessary \\nto publish Jain literature and educational material in a variety of media (i.e. books, videos , cassettes, \\nCDs, DVDs, and web deployment) for English -speaking people interested in Jain philosophy, religion, \\nand scriptures. JAINA Education committee has taken up this task. \\nThe JAINA Education Committee is pleased to present a set of JAINA Education books for students of \\nall ages interested in learning Jainism. These books are grouped into four age levels: Level 1 for \\nelementary, Level 2 for middle school, Level 3 for high school, and Level 4 for college students. The \\nentire list of JAINA Education Series Books is listed in this section. \\nEvery edition of the Päthashälä books go through minor/major revisions incorporating suggestions \\nreceived from various Päthashälä teachers, educators, and students from different centers.  \\nThe education committee members are Jain Päthashälä teachers of various centers and they have spent \\ncountless hours in the preparation /review of this material. Great care has been taken to present the \\nmaterial in a non-sectarian way and incorporate the uniqueness of every Jain sect. Significant effort has \\nbeen made to maintain consistency in the spellings of Jain words. Many youth s have helped us in \\nimproving the English grammar in these books. \\nThe Jain Story Book (JES 202 – Level 2) was originally compiled and coordinated by Pradip an d \\nDarshana Shah of Chicago, Illinois  in 2004 . A great deal of effort has been taken by them for the \\npreparation of the material. Significant time was spent in the selection of the stories. The stories were \\nselected from the previous version of JAINA Education story book, the story book of Shri Manubhai Doshi, \\nand few of the stories wer e gathered from various sources  and we are grateful to the authors and \\npublishers for being able to use their work liberally. We are thankful to Anita Parikh of Connecticut for the \\ndesign and layout of this book. \\nWe needed to modify the popular versions of certain stories because we felt that they violated the basic \\nprinciples of the Jain religion and in some cases they were not conducive to American culture which \\ntreats men and women equally. \\nThe following stories have been modified from their popular version: \\n1. Chandanbälä – \\nThe popular story indicates that Chandanbälä had no tears when ascetic Mahävir came to her \\nhouse for Gochari and then he turn ed around.  Immediately Chandanbälä started crying and \\nMahävir turn around and accepted Gochari.  This explanation violates the monk’s conduct with \\nregards to acceptance rules of Gochari. Monks cannot go back to the same house twice for'),\n",

However, in Upadeshmälä \\nDoghatti Tika of Shri Ratnaprabhsoori translated by Acharya Shri Hems ägarsoori on page 43 \\n(eLibrary book 008467) indicates that the tears were present when a scetic Mahävir saw \\nChandanbälä.  He accepted the Gochari of Adadana Bakla in his hand. \\n2. Aimuttä muni \\nThe popular story states that at the early age of 7 years, Aimuttä muni sincerely repented for his \\nmistake and attained Keval-jnän.  While Jain literature indicates the person should be at least 8 \\nyears of age before he is eligible to take Dikshä.  In Rushimandalstav Prakaran, Aimuttä muni \\nrepents at the age of 13 remembering the earlier incidence and attains Keval-jnän. \\n3. Shälibhadra \\nThe popular story states that before renunciation, Shälibhadra decided to give-up one wife every \\nday, and at the end of 32 days he would become monk.  This indicates that he was treating his \\n32 wives as his property, which is against Jain principles and the American culture.  We have \\nmodified the story indicating that he decided to renounce the world over the period of a month. \\n4. Bhagawän Mallinäth \\nThe popular story states that Bhagawän Mallinäth, in a previous life as a monk named Mahäbal \\nwas secretly observing longer penances without informing the other monks.  In essence, he was \\ndeceiving the other monks.  This is the reason Bhagawän Mallinäth was born as a female.  This \\nis against American culture. \\nJain scriptures are written using Devanägari characters. To pronounce these characters in English \\ncorrectly, it is n ecessary to put various diacritical marks on some English vowels and consonants. \\nHowever, most internet browsers and word processors do not display and print all these transliterated \\ncharacters. The main objective of these books is to teach the principles of Jainism to Jain youth and lay \\npeople who do not have the knowledge of this transliteration convention. As a result, a simplified \\ndiacritical mark scheme has been adopted for this series. The transliteration used here is neither \\nauthentic nor totally consistent. While it will serve the purpose of learning Jain principles, this book should \\nnot be used for learning correct pronunciations. \\nPlease note that the JAINA Education committee members are Jain Päthashälä teachers and are not \\nJain scholars. Hence, you may find some errors in the presentation. Certain items may be applicable to \\none Jain sect and not applicable to other Jain sects. Please pardon us for any mistakes, oversights, \\nunderstatements, or overstatements in the material. We request you to use an d review the material \\nobjectively and provide suggestions to enable us to incorporate them easily in future revisions. \\nIn line with Jain Philosophy, the JAINA education book series is not copyrighted. However, if you need \\nto copy and distribute any of the material, please do it respectfully and on a cost basis. Please note that \\nmost of these books and other material are available from the Jain eLibrary website - \\nwww.jaineLibrary.org. \\nA lot of minds and blessings, both directly and indirectly, have touched t his noble project. We sincerely \\nappreciate and thank every person and every organization that made this project successful. As always, \\nif you have any comments and suggestions for improvement, please feel free to contact us.

Every day he \\nwould donate many gold coins, jewels, precious stones, \\nand clothes.  This unique and unprecedented charity \\nimpressed upon the minds of the people that “Charity is a \\ndouble blessing - it blesses those who give as well those \\nwho receive”. \\nAt the end of the year marked by generosity, Prince \\nVardhamän attained perfect “Aparigrahatva”, freedom \\nfrom attachments and possessions.

When the light of his knowledge \\nwas extinguished from the world, they lit numerous earthen \\nlamps, beginning the tradition of the Festival of Lights known \\nas Deepävali or Diwäli.  Upon Bhagawän Mahävir  achieving \\nthe fifth Kalyänak, Indra and the other gods flew down to earth \\nto celebrate.  They bathed his body with holy waters, applied \\nsandal paste, dressed the body in rich garments and adorned \\nit with a crown and other ornaments.  He was carried in a \\npalanquin. Millions joined  the procession to pay their last \\nhomage.  There was solemn music accompanied on musical \\ninstruments.  The palanquin was placed on a pyre of fragrant \\nsandalwood; after the final prayers were offered, the fire was \\nlit.  Later, perfumed water was sprinkled t o extinguish the fire \\nand the gods carried the molars and the bones to heaven. \\nBhagawän Mahävir’s sermons were compiled orally by his immediate disciples in 12 books in the form of sutras.  \\nThese books are called Anga Ägam Sutras.  Later, several learned Ächäryas (Shruta Kevali monks) compiled many \\nmore books to further explain the Anga Ägam Sutras.  All these books are called Ägams or Ägam Sutras and are \\nconsidered the scriptures of the Jain religion.  These Ägam Sutras were passed on orally to future gene rations of \\nascetics, although over the course of time, some of the Ägam Sutras were lost.  Approximately one thousand years \\nlater, the memorized Ägam Sutras were organized and recorded on tädpatris (palm leaves used as paper to \\npreserve records for future references). \\nBhagawän Mahävir preached that Right Faith (Samyag -Darshan), Right Knowledge (Samyag -Jnän), and Right \\nConduct (Samyag-Chäritra).

The Jain time cycle has no beginning or end.  It continuously migrates from periods of progress to \\nperiods of decline.  According to Jain tradition, a period of progress, known as an Utsarpini or an ascending order, \\nis marked with all-around improvement, including longer lifespan, greater prosperity, and overall happiness.  On the \\nother hand, a period of decline, known as an Avasarpini or a descending order, is marked with all -around \\ndeterioration and decline such as a shorter life span and general gloom.  These two periods together make one -\\ntime cycle. \\nEach Utsarpini and Avasarpini is divided into six eras called Äräs, meaning the spokes of a wheel.  We are currently \\nin the fifth Ärä of the Avasarpini period.  It is also known as Dusham or Dukham (Unhappy) Ärä.  Hindu tradition \\ncalls it Kaliyuga. \\nUntil the end of the third Ärä of the current Avasarpini, people led a natural and simple life.  The population was \\nsmall and nature provided all the necessities for human beings; trees provided shelter and enough leaves and bark \\nfor covering their bodies.  With the help of the branches, they could erect huts for protection from rain and extreme \\nweather.  When they felt hungry, they could pick their food from the trees and bushes.  There was enough flowing \\nwater for cleaning their bodies and quenching their thirst.  As such, there was no struggle for existence or rivalry for \\nsurvival, and people spent their lives in peace. \\nThe people lived in tribes, each of which had a le ader \\nknown as a Kulkar or King.  Towards the end of the third \\nÄrä, there lived a Kulkar named Näbhiräyä who managed \\nhis community  peacefully.  In due course, his beautiful \\nwife, Queen Marudevi, gave birth to Rishabh. \\nThe world’s conditions started changing  after Rishabh \\nwas born.  There was an increase in population and \\nnature no longer remained as bountiful as it used to be.  \\nThis gave rise to a struggle for the acquisition and \\naccumulation of the necessities of life; the emotions of \\njealousy and envy arose.  Näbhiräyä, as the leader of the \\ncommunity, tried to restrain the struggle to the utmo st \\npossible extent.  As Rishabh  grew to be a bold, \\nintelligent, and enthusiastic young man, Näbhiräyä \\nentrusted the management of the kingdom to him. \\nRishabh was a visionary, a thinker, and an inventor.  He \\nforesaw that the struggle for survival would become \\nworse unless some system of producing the necessities \\nof life was created.  He realized that people could make \\nan effort to obtain what they needed from nature inst ead \\nof relying exclusively on natural bounties.  He therefore \\nevolved the art of crop cultivation and taught people how \\nto grow food and fiber.  Thus, he ushered in what we call \\nthe age of material civilization. \\nTo make the lives of people more comfortable, he taught \\nthem how to make utensils, cook food, build houses, \\nmake clothes, cultivate land, and raise animals like cows \\nand horses.

Thus, a social order evolved and Rishabh, as the first \\nacknowledged ruler in human society, came to be known \\nas King Rishabhadev.  During his long rule, he laid down \\nequitable rules and regulations for ensuring peace and \\nsafety within his realm. People of his kingdom’s loved King \\nRishabhadev for providing peace and happiness. \\nRishabhadev had 100 sons; the eldest two were called \\nBharat and Bähubali.  He also had two daughters, Brähmi \\nand Sundari.  These four children were experts in different \\narts and crafts.  Bharat became a brave warrior and a \\ncapable ruler.  Jain literature indicates that India was \\nnamed “Bhärat” after him.  Bähubali, true to his name \\n(Bähu means arm and Bali means mighty), was known for \\nhis exceptional arm strength.  Brähmi evolved the art of \\nwriting and developed the Brähmi script in which most of \\nthe scriptures were written.  Her sister, Sundari, cultivated \\nan exceptional talent in mathematics. \\nRishabhadev was proud and happy of his achievements \\nand felt content with his ruler ship.  However, one day an \\nincident occurred that changed his way of thinking.  As he \\nwas watching a dance, the dancer suddenly collapsed and \\ndied.  Rishabhadev was very disturbed by the sudden \\ndeath and began pondering over the death of the dancer.  \\nHe soon realized that every phenomenon and every \\nsituation in the universe undergoes changes—no situation \\nremains permanent. \\nUpon this realization, Rishabhadev (Ädinäth) decided to renounce worldly life in search of lasting happiness.  He \\ngave Bharat the city of Vinitä, entrusted the city of Taxshilä to Bähubali, and distributed the other parts of his vast \\nkingdom to the remaining 98 sons.  He then renounced all his possessions and became a  monk in search of the \\nultimate truth.  Four thousand of his associates and followers joined him in renouncing worldly life.  \\nAs a monk, Rishabhadev traveled from place to place.  He remained in a state of continuous meditation, not thinking \\nof food or water.  However, his deep meditation meant that he could not guide his followers on how they should live \\ntheir lives as monks.  His followers were unable to fast like him, but they did not want to go back.  They became \\nconfused as to how to behave and decided to live on fruits and vegetables obtained from the nearby jungles. \\nAfter some time, Rishabhadev could see their miserable condition.  Jain monks are not supposed to pick any fruits \\nand vegetables from trees by themselves, but instead go to laypeople’s hous es for alms.  He therefore decided to \\ndemonstrate the way a monk was supposed to live.  He started going from house to house for alms in silence.  \\nHowever, people did not know what to offer Rishabhadev, their once beloved King.  They offered him ornaments,  \\ntheir homes, and other valuable items, but no one thought of offering food.  As a result, Rishabhadev had to continue \\nfasting day after day. \\nAfter fasting in this way for 400 days (thirteen months and nine days), Rishabhadev passed by a sugarcane farm \\nlocated near the town of Hastinäpur.  The farm belonged to his great grandson, Shreyäns, who chose to offer \\nRishabhadev sugarcane juice.  Thus, Rishabhadev finally ended his long fast on the third day of the bright half of \\nthe month of Vaisakha.  Known as Aks haya Tritiya, this day usually falls in the month of May.  In commemoration \\nof Rishabhadev’s fast, people observe a similar austerity known as Varsitapa.

All of these cities were located \\nin the present states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. \\nKing Kumbha and Queen Prabhävati lovingly raised their children Malli and Malladin.

Princess Malli mastered all the fine arts and became a \\ntalented and accomplished princess.

A marvelous building was constructed for \\nthis purpose and all well-known artists were invited to make their artistic contribution to the gallery.  One artist from \\nHastinäpur possessed a special power to prepare an accurate portrait of anyone by merely seeing one part of his \\nor her body.  He once happened to see the toe of princess Malli and from that, he drew an accurate portrait of \\nprincess Malli on the wall.  Even the smallest details were accurately portrayed.  It was so lifelike that when prince \\nMalladin came to see the gallery and looked at the portrait, he felt as if his sister were standing there and actually \\nfolded his hands as a token of respect. \\nWhen he realized that it was merely a portrait, he was puzzled as to how the artist had obtained such minute details \\nof his sister’s body.  He was told of the special power and the talent that the artist possessed.  Although he \\nrecognized the rarity of this accomplishment, the prince also foresaw the dangers of such a talent.

The artist refused and insisted upon his freedom  of artistic expression.

He sent a marriage proposal to \\nKing Kumbha of Mithilä. \\nIn the same manner the kings of Ayodhyä, Champä, Käshi, Kämpily apur and Shrävasti also  learned of the \\nexceptional beauty of princess Malli and sent marriage proposals.  After considering these proposals, King Kumbha \\ndid not find any of them suitable for Malli and rejected them all.

When the \\nYädava King Samudravijay ruled over Saur ipura with his wife, Shivädevi, they had a son, Lord Neminäth, and \\nnamed him Nemkumär.  Because his mother dreamt of a series of black jewels called Arista when he was in her \\nwomb, he is also known as Aristanemi. \\nKing Väsudev, the \\nyounger brother of King \\nSamudravijay, was the \\nKing of Mathurä.  He had \\ntwo queens; Queen \\nRohini, who had a son \\nnamed Balräm (Padma), \\nand Queen Devaki, who \\nhad a son named Shri \\nKrishna.  Both Balräm \\nand Shri Krishna were the \\nninth Baldev and \\nVäsudev as per Jain \\ntradition.  Shri Krishna is \\nalso the incarnation of \\nLord Vishnu (God) in the \\nHindu religion. \\nDuring this time, hunting \\nwas a favored sport and \\ngambling was considered \\na respectable activity.  \\nReligious ceremonies \\nincluded animal sacrific e, \\nand a non-vegetarian diet \\nwas very popular. \\nMeanwhile, the whole area of central India had been disturbed due to the prevailing conspiracies among various \\nkingdoms.

When he became older, many families were eager to have \\ntheir daughters marry him.  It was a no rmal practice in those days for a man to have more than one wife, so his \\nparents selected 8 girls from reputed families.  Jambu was duly engaged to all of them.  It was a joyous time for all. \\nOne day, Mahävir-swami’s ganadhar, Sudharmä-swämi, came to Räjgrihi to deliver a sermon and Jambu attended \\nthe assembly.  The sermon encouraged him to develop a very high sense of detachment towards worldly objects \\nand family members and he decided to renounce his worldly life.  However, Jambu’s parents were dismayed t o \\nhear of his intentions to renounce the world at such a young age.  The parents of the eight girls who were engaged \\nto Jambu were also very worried that no one else would marry their daughters because of their engagement to \\nJambu. \\nThey all tried to convince Jambu to relinquish his plans of becoming a monk, telling him that the rigors of an ascetic \\nlife would pose a challenge for him and that he did not realize what he was sacrificing.  They advised him to live a \\ncomfortable family life, reminding him of his obligations towards them and his future wives.  Jambu patiently listened \\nto them, but he remained firm in his decision. \\nFinally, the parents made one last effort to persuade him.  \\nThinking that Jambu would change his  mind after being \\nmarried, they requested that he get married before they gave \\ntheir blessing for his renunciation.  Jambu agreed to get \\nmarried with one condition: he would become an ascetic the \\nday after his marriage.  His parents agreed to this conditio n \\nsince they thought he would fall in love with the girls once he \\nwas married and would give up the idea of renouncing the \\nworld. \\nThe wedding took place on a grand scale.

During Mahävir’s time, it was \\nruled by King Shrenik of the Shishunäg dynasty.   This dynasty ended with the death of Shrenik’s great -grandson \\nUdayi.  Magadha then passed into the hands of the Nanda dynasty.  Nine generations later, Dhanänand ascended \\nthe throne.  This was around 300 BCE, about 200 years after Lord Mahävir’s nirväna. \\nThe greedy Dhanänand was far from being a just and noble ruler.  He had heard a legend about hidden treasure \\nthat belonged to one of his predecessors and was desperate to get his hands on it.  Unfortunately, he had no idea \\nwhere this treasure was hidden.  However, he knew that the old Prime Minister Shaktäl, who had served his father, \\nhad knowledge of the treasure’s whereabouts.  Dhanänand therefore tried everything he could to get the information \\nfrom the prime minister and locate the treasure, but Shaktä l refused to provide any information about the \\nwhereabouts of this treasure.  The King therefore forced him to retire and the administration was entrusted to other \\nministers. \\nShaktäl was a wise, highly respected person in the \\nkingdom.  Many scholars and high ranking officials admired \\nhim and were eager to consult him on important matters.  \\nHowever, they avoided communicating with him because \\nthey feared that the King would not approve. \\nShaktäl had seven daughters and two sons, Sthulibhadra \\nand Shriyäk.  Sthulibhadra was smart, brilliant, and \\nhandsome, but unambitious.  From a very young age, \\nSthulibhadra had watched the performance of a beautiful \\ndancer named Koshä in Pätliputra, the capital city of \\nMagadha.  Eventually, they fell in love .  Though his family \\ndisapproved, Sthulibhadra was deeply in love and left home \\nat the young age of 18 to live with Koshä.  He was infatuated \\nwith her and abandoned all interest in his career and other \\nfamily members.  King Dhanänand had intended to appoint \\nhim to a high position in the court, but Sthulibhadra declined \\nthe offer.  The King therefore appointed his younger \\nbrother, Shriyäk, to the position. \\nAs time passed, things began to look grim for Dhanänand’s \\nreign.  The citizens of Magadha witnessed major political \\nupheavals and turmoil.  People felt dissatisfie d with the \\ncurrent regime and looked for the end of the Nanda \\ndynasty.  King Dhanänand felt insecure and was suspicious \\nof all his ministers and advisors, including Shriyäk and his \\nfather Shaktäl. \\nAware that the King was very suspicious of him, Shaktäl bec ame worried about the political future of his younger \\nson.  Shaktäl therefore decided to sacrifice his life in order to provide proof of Shriyäk’s loyalty to the King.  He \\nrequested his son, Shriyäk, to kill him in the presence of the King and other minist ers.  This way, the King would \\nhave proof that Shriyäk was a very loyal minister.  Prior to the execution, he explained to Shriyäk that he would \\nswallow some poison so that Shriyäk would not truly (morally and religiously) be responsible for his father’s d eath.  \\nMeanwhile, the King would feel that Shriyäk was very loyal to him because he had seemingly killed his own father \\nfor the King.  Thus, Shaktäl died seemingly at the hands of his own son in order to prove his son’s loyalty.  \\nWhen Sthulibhadra learned about that tragic event, he was taken aback.  By that time, he had spent twelve years \\nwith Koshä and had never cared for anyone else.  His father’s death opened his eyes, and he started reflecting on \\nhis past.  “Twelve long years of my youth!

The first three monks described \\ntheir success and they were congratulated.  But when Sthulibhadra reported the success of his te st, the Ächärya \\nactually rose from his seat in all praise and hailed Sthulibhadra for performing a formidable task.  The other monks \\nbecame jealous.  Why was Sthulibhadra’s feat so much more impressive than theirs?  After all, they had endured \\nphysical hardships while he had spent the monsoon in comfort and security.  The Ächärya explained that it was an \\nimpossible feat for anyone else.  The first monk then boasted that he could easily accomplish the same task the \\nfollowing monsoon.  The Ächärya tried to dissuade him from his intent, knowing that it was beyond his capability.  \\nThe monk, wanting to prove his spiritual strength to the Ächärya, persisted and was reluctantly given permission \\nfor the next monsoon season. \\nThe next monsoon, the monk went to Koshä’s place.  The immodest pictures in the gallery were enough to excite \\nhim.  When he saw the glamorous Koshä, his remaining resistance melted away and he begged for her love.  After \\nseeing the pious life of Sthulibhadra, Koshä had learned the value of an ascetic life.  In order to teach the monk a \\nlesson, she agreed to love him \\nonly if he gave her a diamond-\\nstudded garment from Nep al, \\na t own 250 miles north of \\nPätliputra.  The monk was so \\ninfatuated that he left \\nimmediately for Nepal, \\nforgetting that monks were not \\nsupposed to travel during the \\nmonsoon.  With considerable \\ndifficulty, he procur ed the \\ngarment and returned to \\nPätliputra, conf ident of \\nreceiving Koshä’s love.  \\nKoshä accepted the beautiful \\ngarment, wiped her feet on it \\nand threw it away in the trash. \\nThe monk was stunned.  He \\nasked, “Are you crazy, \\nKoshä?  Why are you throwing away the precious gift that I have brought you with s o much difficulty?” Koshä \\nreplied, “Why are you throwing away the precious life of monkhood that you have acquired with so much effort?” \\nThe humbled monk realized his foolishness and returned to his Ächärya to report his miserable failure.  From that \\nday onwards, there was immense respect for Sthulibhadra throughout the community.  \\nSthulibhadra played a major role in later years preserving the oldest Jain scriptures, known as the twel ve Anga \\nÄgams and the fourteen p urvas.  Jain history indicates that Ächärya Bhadrabähu, the successor of Ächärya \\nSambhutivijay as the head of the religious order, was the last monk to have complete knowledge of all the Jain \\nscriptures.  Both Ächärya Sambhutivijay and Ächärya Bhadrabähu had been the disciples of Ächärya Yashobhadra. \\nIn those days, the Jain scriptures were memorized and passed down orally from guru to disciple.  They were not \\ndocumented in any form.  Under the leadership of Ächärya Bhadrabähu, Sthulibhadra thoroughly studied eleven of \\nthe twelve Anga Ägams.  However , an extended famine prevented Sthulibhadra from studying the twelfth Anga \\nÄgam, known as Drashtiväd, which contained the 14 purvas.  During the famine, Ächärya Bhadrabähu-swämi \\nmigrated south with 12, 000 disciples.  Ächärya Sthulibhadra succeeded him as the leader of the monks who stayed \\nbehind in Pätliputra.  The hardships of the famine made it difficult for the monks to observe their code of conduct \\nproperly.  In addition, many of the monks’ memories failed them and many parts of the Anga Ägams were forgotten. \\nThe famine lasted for twelve years.  After the famine, Sthulibhadra decided to recompile the Jain scriptur es.  A \\nconvention was held in Pätliputra under the leadership of Ächärya Sthulibhadra.  Eleven of the twelve Anga Ägams \\nwere orally recompiled at the convention, but none of the monks at the convention could remember the twelfth Anga \\nÄgam and its 14 purvas.  Only Ächärya Bhadrabähu swämi had this knowledge; he had left southern India and was \\nnow in the mountains of Nepal to practice a special pe nance and meditation.  The Jain sangh therefore requested \\nSthulibhadra and some other learned monks to go to Ächärya Bhadrabähu-swämi and learn the twelfth Ägam.  \\nThe monk was unable to stay detached seeing Koshä’s beauty and \\nforgot his vows in the hope of receiving Koshä’s love'),\n",

During that time, it was common for scholars to travel and engage \\nothers in debate to increase their wealth of knowledge.  Therefore, Haribhadra traveled and debated many brilliant \\nscholars.  Other scholars were un able to win discussions with him.  His talent allowed him to dominate all \\nconversations.  It was not long before he earned a formidable reputation, and scholars began avoiding entering into \\na discussion with him. \\nWhen no one came forward to counter him, he  concluded that he had no rival in the entire country.  Confident in \\nhis ability to comprehend any subject being discussed, he issued a public challenge that if anyone could present a \\ntopic that he could not understand, he would readily become his/her pupi l. \\nOne day, as he was walking through the village, he came across a royal elephant so angry that it was completely \\nout of control.  His keeper was trying his best to bring him under control, but the elephant was not responding to his \\nefforts.  The elephant  was running directly towards Haribhadra.  In grave danger of being trampled, Haribhadra \\nfrantically looked around for a safe place and saw a Jain temple.  He entered just in time to avoid being crushed by \\nthe charging elephant.  Once inside, he paused to regain his breath and then looked around the temple with \\ndisrespect.  Haribhadra had no regard for Jainism.  Because of his prejudice, he remained ignorant of Jain \\nphilosophy.  Brahmins were usually staunch Shaiväites (followers of Lord Shiva in Hinduism) and looked down upon \\nthose going to Jain temples. \\nAs he looked around, he saw the white marble idol of Lord Mahävir facing him.  Instead of seeing the graceful \\ncompassion flowing from the eyes of the Tirthankar’s idol, Haribhadra only noticed that the stomach of the idol did \\nnot epitomize the slim body of an austere saint.  He surmised that Jain Tirthankars must have enjoyed sweet foods.  \\nHe therefore made the following remark: \\n“Vapurevatavächashte Spashtam Mishtänn-Bhojitämit” \\n“Your stomach clearly indicates that you must enjoy eating sweet foods” \\nWhen the elephant left the area, Haribhadra stepped outside the temple.  On his way back, he passed the Upäshray \\nof Jain nuns (Sädhvis).  He heard the following verse that was recited by a Sädhvi named Yäkini Mahattarä:  \\nChakkidugam Haripanagam Panagam Chakki Ya Kesavo Chakki \\nKesav Chakki Kesav Du Chakki Kesi Ya Chakki Ya  \\nHaribhadra-Suri listening to Yäkini Mahattarä’s explaining Jain philosophy'),\n",

Despite his arrogance, Haribhadra was also a man of his word, and without further \\nhesitation, he presented himself to the Jain nun Mahattarä.  He explained his pledge and requested that she accept \\nhim as a pupil.  Mahattarä explained that Jain nuns could not have males as pupils.

Luckily, sädhvi Mahattarä convinced him to abandon \\nthe idea of killing his opponent.

Additionally, he had once saved \\nthe future King’s life.  Kumärpäl therefore considered Hemchandra his spiritual teacher (guru) and benefactor and \\ngave him exceptional honor.  Kumärpäl sought Hemchandra’s advice in shaping his kingdom, and in a very short \\ntime Gujarat became a center of non-violence, learning, and good culture. \\nIn his efforts, Hemchandra did not think of the development of his own career but always of the welfare of all citizens.  \\nHowever, some Brahmins were very jealous of Ächärya Hemchandra’s influence over the King and tried to disgrace \\nVarious incidences from Ächärya Hemchandra and King \\nKumärpäl’s life'),\n",

By Sumangalä, he had 99 sons, of whom Bharat was the eldest and the best \\nknown, and one daughter named Brähmi.  By the second wife, Sunandä, he had one son named Bähubali and a \\ndaughter named Sundari.  All of them were given proper training in different arts and crafts.  Bharat became a great \\nwarrior and a politician.  Sunandä's son was tall, well built, and strong, and hence was called Bähubali.  In Sanskrit, \\n“Bähu” means arm and “Bali” means mighty.  Brähmi attained a very high level of literary proficiency.  She developed \\nthe first known script, known as the Brähmi script.  Sundari was very proficient in mathematics.  After Lord \\nRishabhadev attained omniscience, both girls renounced their worldly lives and became his disciples. \\nAs a King, Rishabhadev had the responsibility of a large kingdom.  At the time of his renunciation, he handed over \\nthe city of Vinitä, also known as Ayodhyä, to Bharat, an d the city of Taxshilä ( Pottanpur according to Digambar \\nscriptures) to Bähubali.  He gave different parts of his vast kingdom to his remaining 98 sons.  \\nBharat quickly established control over Vinitä.  He was an ambitious ruler and intended to become empero r of the \\nentire nation.  For this purpose, he organized a strong army and started developing different types of fighting \\nequipment.  He also possessed a miraculous wheel called Chakraratna (“Chakra” means wheel and “ratna” means \\nprecious jewel) that would never miss its target.  After developing his army and weapons, he embarked upon his \\njourney of conquest.  There was hardly anyone at that time who could withstand his well-equipped army.  He easily \\nconquered all the regions around Vinitä.  Then, he turned his attention towards the lands of his 98 brothers and \\nasked them to acknowledge his superiority.  They all turned to Lord Rishabhadev to ask for advice.  Bhagawän \\nexplained to them the importance of conquering their inner enemies (passions) and not external enemies.

However, he had a different vision and would not surrender.  He was conscious of \\nhis right to rule the kingdom handed over to him by his father.  Moreover, he had the will and capacity to fight any \\ninvader.  Therefore, wh en he received Bharat’s request to accept a subordinate status, he refused and began \\npreparations to fight. \\nBoth brothers were strong, and war between the two was sure to result in large -scale bloodshed.  Therefore, \\ncounselors on both sides tried to dissua de their masters from resorting to war, but neither of them would give up \\nhis ground.  War seemed inevitable as the brothers brought their armies face to face on the battlefield.  Everyone \\nshuddered at the prospect of the heavy casualties that would result from the imminent war. \\nThe counselors then made one last effort.  They explained to their masters that the main point of contention was to \\ndetermine which brother was superior.  Instead of assembling a large -scale war for that purpose, a fight between \\nthe two brothers would just as easily settle the issue and would avert unnecessary bloodshed.  Both brothers thought \\nthis was an excellent idea and immediately agreed.  The plan was to engage in a straight duel, and the victor of the \\nduel would be acknowledged as the leader. \\nOn the day of the duel, Bharat tried to beat Bähubali by using his various permissible weapons, but all his attempts \\nto defeat Bähubali failed.  Bharat contemplated on how unbearable and shameful his defeat would be.  His ambition \\nto rule the entire world was also at stake if he did not defeat his brother.  He grew desperate and ignored the rules \\nof the duel by unleashing his miracle wheel, the Chakraratna, at Bähubali.  However, he had forgotten one important \\ncharacteristic of the miracle weapon: it would not harm any blood relatives of the bearer.  Therefore, the wheel \\nreturned to Bharat and Bähubali remained unharmed. \\nBähubali became enraged by Bharat’s violation of the rules of the duel, and he thought of smashing his elder brother \\nwith his mighty fist.  As he raised his hand for that purpose, the onlookers trembled at the thought of Bharat’s \\nimminent death. \\nBut just as he was about to unleash his wrath, a flash of insight came to him.  “What am I doing?” thought Bähubali.  \\n“Have I gone m ad?  Am I going to kill my elder brother for the sake of some worldly possessions that my revered \\nfather willingly abandoned and which my other brothers have given up?” He shuddered at the prospect of the \\nimminent death of Bharat, seeing the evil in killing a respected brother.  At that very moment he changed his mind.  \\nInstead of lowering his hand to hit his brother, he used it to pull out his hair (as the monks do during Dikshä) as a \\nsymbol of giving up everything and renouncing the worldly life. \\nHowever, Bähubali had not lost all his pride and ego.  He realized that if he went to his father and stated his intention \\nof renouncing the world, he would be required to bow down and be subservient to his 98 younger brothers who \\nwere senior to him in monkhood.  This was unacceptable to him.  Instead, Bähubali decided to seek enlightenment \\non his own and started meditating on the very same spot upon which he stood.  He became so immersed in his \\nmeditation that he lost track of time and could not remember how long h e had stood there.  He was motionless for \\nso long that creepers began to grow around his feet. \\nA year passed with Bähubali standing in that posture of meditation, yet he did not gain enlightenment.  How could \\nhe gain it without shedding his ego?  At last, Lord Rishabhadev sent Brähmi and Sundari to bring him to the right \\npath.  They came to the place where Bähubali was meditating.  Seeing their mighty brother standing like a rock, \\nthey calmly told him, “You cannot achieve enlightenment while sitting on an e lephant.  You need to get off the \\nelephant.” As their familiar voices reached Bähubali’s ears, he opened his eyes in amazement and looked around \\nbut did not find himself on an elephant.  He then realized that the elephant they were referring to was his ego .  He \\nimmediately dissolved his ego and decided to go to Lord Rishabhadev and was ready to bow to his 98 brothers. \\nDuring his long penance, he had overcome all other defiling passions except ego which still remained between him \\nand enlightenment.  Now his ego was dissolved and humbleness prevailed in its place.  Therefore, as he took the \\nfirst step towards the Lord, he achieved full enlightenment and became omniscient.  (By Digambar tradition, \\nBähubali later became the first person to attain liberation in this era.  However, Shvetämbar tradition indicates that \\nRishabhadev’s mother, Marudevi, attained liberation first in this era.) \\nIn memory of this event, a gigantic, 57 -foot upright statue of Bähubali stands on the hill of Vindhyägiri at \\nShrävanbelgolä, near Bangalore in southern India.  It is made out of a single rock of granite and was erected about \\n1000 years ago.  Pilgrims and visitors marvel that the statue, even under the open sky, stands spotless today.'),\n",

When Shripäl was five years old, his father died.  King Singhrath’s ambitious brother, Ajitsen, took \\nthis opportunity to seize the throne.  In order to make his position as King secure, he was keen to get rid of Shripäl.  \\nWhen Kamal-prabhä became aware of Ajitsen’s vicious plan, she  fled from Champänagar with  her son.  Learning \\nabout her escape, Ajitsen sent his trusted soldiers to pursue her. \\nAs the soldiers got close, she did not know how to save her son.  She saw a group of lepers, and in desperation, \\nshe asked them to take her son into their custody.  They warned her about the risk of her son contracting the \\ndisease of leprosy from them.  However, she had no choice if she wanted to save her son, so she entrusted her \\nson to them. \\nShripäl grew up to be very bold and handsome.  The people of the leper colony be came very fond of him and took \\ngreat care of Shripäl.  Ultimately, Shripäl contracted leprosy.  When he became a youth, the people made him their \\nleader, and named him Umar Ränä.  Under his leadership the group traveled from place to place and one day \\narrived at the city of Ujjayini, the capital of the Mälwä region. \\nKing Prajäpäl was ruling there.  He and Queen Rupsundari had two intelligent and beautiful daughters, Sursundari \\nand Mayanä-sundari.  The King loved both of them and made adequate arrangements for their training in the arts \\nand crafts, which the girls mastered in due course.  One day, the King decided to test their knowledge and called \\nthem in the assembly hall.  He asked a number of questions t o Sursundari who gave satisfactory replies to all of \\nthem.  At the end, the King asked her by whose favor she got all her skills and also the amenities and luxuries that \\nshe enjoyed.  The girl humbly replied that she gained all that by the King’s favor.  Pleased with her replies, the King \\ndecided to reward her appropriately. \\nThen, he asked several questions to Mayanä-sundari.  She too gave satisfactory replies to all his questions.  At the \\nend, the King asked her the same question that he had asked Sursunda ri.  He had expected Mayanä to give an \\nidentical reply and thus please him.  However, Mayanä had total faith in the religious philosophy she had studied at \\nlength.  She firmly believed that everything that she had received had been the result of her karma.  She must have \\nearned good karma in the past that resulted in the happy situations that she was undergoing.  If she did not have \\nthat karma to her credit, no one could bestow happiness on her.  She therefore replied:  “O father! The great King! \\nWith due respect to you, all the comfort that you provide me are only because of my meritorious (Punya) karma.  \\nEveryone gets whatever is written in his or her destiny due to his or her karma.  You yourself cannot give or take \\naway anything.” \\nEverything that she had received had been the result of her Karma.  She must have earned good Karma in the \\npast that resulted in the happy situations that she was undergoing.  If she did not have that Karma to her credit, \\nno one could bestow happiness on her. The King was exasperated to hear the unexpected reply.  He repeatedly \\nasked her to consider how she could have obtained anything without his generosity.  Mayanä replied that \\neverything, right from her being born as his daughter up to her present situation, could occur solely as a \\nconsequence of her good or bad karmas, and no one could have made any difference.  \\nThe King grew angry with her unexpected persistence.  He could not believe that the girl could have received \\nanything without his favor, and did not agree that everything happens according to one’s own karma.  He therefore \\ndecided to teach her a lesson, and asked his men to find the ugliest man in Ujjayini.  The men spotted Umar Ränä \\nand brought him to the court.  In utter disdain, the King instantly got Mayanä married to Umar.  He gave them some \\nbasic things and a small house and asked Mayanä to undergo the result of her karma.  Rupsundari was very \\nunhappy at the sudden turn of events in her daughter’s life, but she could not speak against her husband’s will.  On \\nthe other hand, the King looked for a suitable match for Sursundari in appreciation of her replies and had her married \\nto prince Aridaman of Shankhapuri. \\nMayanä was deeply religious.

Äyambil is \\nobserved by having only one meal a day of very plain food \\nwithout any spices, milk, sugar, salt, oil, butter, fruits, or \\nvegetables (sometimes minor exceptions are made by \\ngurus for certain spices).  Meanwhile, one meditates upon \\nthe Navapad: Arihanta, Siddha, Ächärya, Upädhyäy, \\nSädhus (Pancha Parmesthi), Jnän (knowledge), Darshan \\n(faith), Chäritra (conduct), and Tapa (penance).  This \\npenance and meditation is to be observed for nine days, \\ntwice a year, during the month of March/April (Chaitra) and \\nSeptember/October (Ashwin).  The couple was to do this \\npenance for four and half years, resulting in Nine Äyambil \\nOlis (one every six months). \\nAccordingly, Mayanä and Shripäl devoutly observed the \\nNavapad worship and penance with all  its vitality.  The \\nresult was miraculous.  Shripäl’s skin disease started \\nfading, and in due course, he was totally cured of leprosy \\nand regained the skin that he had before contracting the \\ndisease.  Now he looked like the handsome prince that he \\nhad been.  Mayanä was very happy with this result and \\nthanked her karma for that change too.

Eventually, as the son of Ilächi, he came to be known as Ilächiputra and then Ilächikumär.  He was \\nraised with care and attention and never lacked any luxuries, growing up to be a handsome youth.  Soon, his parents \\nfelt it was time to find a wife for him.  Luckily, th ey did not need to look very far as they were a prosperous family \\nand Ilächikumär was their only son.  Many families wanted their daughters to marry him.  His parents prepared a \\nlist of selected names and asked Ilächikumär to choose the one that he liked the most.  However, Ilächikumär could \\nnot make a selection. \\nOne day, a party of acrobats came to Ilävardhan.  In those days there were no stadiums where acrobats could \\nperform, so they performed their routines for their audience on the open streets.  Beatin g drums to announce their \\narrival, the acrobats planted poles in an open square off the main street and connected them with ropes while a \\nlarge crowd gathered.  They then began their routine, climbing the poles one after another and demonstrating their \\nskills, walking and jumping over the high rope with ease above the fascinated audience.  Attracted by the \\ncommotion, Ilächikumär also went to watch the show.  While enjoying the performance, his attention was drawn to \\nthe chief acrobat’s beautiful young daugh ter who was dancing gracefully to the drums with bells on her feet.  \\nIlächikumär was so mesmerized by her beauty and charm that he could not take his eyes off her.  \\nAt the end of the show, the acrobats descended the rope and started collecting money from th e audience.  People \\nwere very pleased with the performance and paid handsomely.  After collecting a large amount of money, the \\nacrobats left the square to camp for the night and everyone else went home.  Though Ilächikumär also returned \\nhome, his mind was still on the beautiful girl he had seen that day.  At dinner, his parents found him silent and \\nunresponsive; they had never seen him so dazed.  His father questioned his absent -mindedness, but he did not \\nanswer.  When his mother persistently asked for the reason for his silence, he finally replied that his heart was \\nattracted to the acrobat girl and he wanted to marry her. \\nHis mother was taken aback to hear that.  She said that she could find him a very beautiful and lovable girl from a \\nhigh caste and respectable family and asked him to forget the lower caste acrobat girl, but Ilächikumär replied that \\nhe had never met any other girl who attracted him and he wanted to marry her.  Acknowledging his resolve on the \\nmatter, she told her husband about their son’s intentions. \\nDhandatta was shocked to hear this.  He tried to dissuade his son from his intentions but Ilächikumär remained \\nfirm.  Since Dhandatta was a sensible man, he could see that Ilächikumär would not be at peace without that girl.  \\nHe did not want to  lose his son for the sake of prestige.  Therefore, he called the chief of acrobats and requested \\nhim to give his daughter in marriage to Ilächikumär. \\nHowever, the acrobat refused, saying that he was bound by a condition of his tribe.  Dhandatta thought th at he \\nmight be looking for money for the girl and offered to give as much wealth as the acrobat wanted in return for \\nagreeing to marry his daughter to Ilächikumär.  The acrobat  however declined the offer and again replied that he \\ncould not break the condition, so Dhandatta then asked him what this condition was.  The acrobat said that he could \\ngive his daughter only to a person who could win an award from a royal court by pleasing the King with his acrobatic \\nskill and then use the prize money to provide dinner to his community. \\nDhandatta was disappointed to hear a condition that was apparently impossible for his son to fulfill.  After he \\nexplained to his wife what had happened, she told her son and said that the girl would only marry an expert acrobat \\nand asked him to forget her. \\nIlächikumär was silent but his mind was racing with thoughts.  He felt that he would not be able to live happily \\nwithout the girl and was willing to make any sacrifice for her.  He decided that he was even prepared to learn \\nacrobatic skills for that purpose.  His parents misunderstood his silence as disappointment and thought that in time \\nhe would recover.  For a time, they tried to divert his attention to other matters to help him forget and Ilächikumär \\nallowed them to believe that t hey were succeeding, but his mind was made up.

He was surprised at the kind of karma he had acquired where he could not fast even for a day, but \\nhe reluctantly approached the guru and begged for his permission to go for alms.  The guru lovingly tried to persuade \\nhim to go without food for just one day, feeling that he should be inspired to observe a fast at least for that day, \\nespecially when all the other monks were on long fasts.  Kurgadu humbly replied that he did wish to observe a fast \\nand very much regretted his inability to fast.  Due to his humility, the guru took pity on his fate and compassionately \\nallowed him to go for alms. \\nKurgadu went for alms and accepted the food that was offered to him.  Returning, he presented the alms to his guru \\nas part of the monk’s code of conduct and modestly begged his permission to eat.  Although the guru gave his \\npermission willingly, the other monks made negative remarks.  They unsympathetically said that he did not deserve \\nto be a monk for eating on an auspicious day.  Kurgadu listened to the remarks quietly.  He went to a corner and \\nreluctantly started to eat. \\nWhile eating, Kurgadu dwelt deeply on the inability of his body to remain without food for a day.   Learned as he \\nwas, he could see that it must be the result of his previous karma.  He understood that all karmas are shed after \\nextending the appropriate consequence and this karma too would be shed.  He made up his mind to passively \\naccept what had been ordained by his karma.  Because of his study of the scriptures, he had gained insight about \\nthe true nature of his soul.  Earlier, despising himself for not observing a fast had prevented him from full realization \\nof that true nature.  Now  his willingness to accept what was a physical limitation endowed him with the insight of \\ndistinguishing the nature of the soul from the varying states of the body and mind.  His new-found insight gave rise \\nto the manifestation of the true nature of the soul, and his real ization was strong enough to destroy all the defiling \\nkarmas on the spot and he gained omniscience (keval-jnän) immediately while he was eating. \\nWhen one attains omniscience, the heavenly beings arrive to offer their obeisance.  When other monks saw the \\nheavenly beings coming towards them, they thought that the heavenly beings were coming to praise them for their \\nsevere austerities.  Instead, the heavenly beings turned to Kurgadu and offered their obeisance to him.  No one \\ncould understand why those observi ng severe austerity were left out while the one who could not observe it at all \\nhad gained full enlightenment. \\nIn amazement, the monks went to Dharmaghosh -suri and asked him the reason for what had happened.  The \\nÄchärya said that they were all feeling ver y proud of their austerities and were unnecessarily disapproving of \\nKurgadu for not observing a fast.  Therefore, they were smeared by perception obscuring karma.  He urged them \\nto bear in mind that the primary purpose of observing austerities or any other religious practice was to gain modesty \\nthat leads to right perception, which in turn helps to attain equanimity. \\nThe monks had misjudged Kurgadu, who had realized the essence of religion.  Earlier, he had acquired obstructing \\nkarma that did not allow him to observe the austerity.  He sincerely repented for that karma which had become \\noperative in his current life, and by properly comprehending the role of karma, he acquired right perception.  By \\nbearing the consequence of those karmas with equanimity, he w as able to wipe them out without acquiring new \\nones.  Thereupon, the monks realized that they were indulging in unnecessary vanity that obstructed right \\nperception.'),\n",

Once, while she was \\nsleeping, she dreamt of a white elephant entering her mouth.  She immediately woke up and told the King about \\nher dream.  King Shrenik knew that it w as an auspicious dream.  He called the dream experts who predicted that \\nthe queen would give birth to a very handsome and intelligent son who will excel in everything.  The King and queen \\nwere very pleased to hear this. \\nDuring the third month of her pregnancy, queen Dhärini \\nhad an irresistible urge to ride an elephant in the country \\nwith the King with the sky decorated with clouds of colorful \\nhues, lightning flashing, and rain pouring.  In most parts of \\nIndia, it only rai ns during the monsoon season, which is \\nusually from June to October.  Queen Dhärini, however, \\nhad the urge during the off -season.  The fulfillment of her \\nurge was therefore a problem.  In order to see that her \\nhealth and well-being were not affected by the unsatisfied \\nurge, the King asked his eldest son, Abhaykumär, who was \\nalso the Prime Minister of the state, for a solution to satisfy \\nthe queen’s urge.  Abhaykumär had a friend who could do \\nmiracles.  The friend arranged events according to \\nDhärini’s urge.   She was therefore able to ride on an \\nelephant with the King and satisfy her urge. \\nIn due course, Queen Dhärini gave birth to a very \\nhandsome and adorable baby boy.  Rain in the  Indian \\nlanguage is called Megh, so in commemoration of her urge \\nduring pregnancy, the boy was named Meghakumär.  At \\nthe age of 8, he was sent to school, where he learned all \\n72 types of arts and crafts and became an accomplished \\nyouth.  He got married and enjoyed all the pleasures of \\nworldly life. \\nOnce, Lord Mahävir came to Räjgrih i, the capital city of \\nMagadha, and stayed in the Gunashil monastery.  Almost \\nevery resident of Räjgrihi went to listen to his sermons.  \\nMeghakumär went as well.  The sermon made a lasting impression on him.  He realized the transitory nature of \\nworldly situations and decided to renounce his worldly life.  His parents were sad to hear about his plan.  They tried \\neverything possible to prevent him from renouncing his worldly life.  However, he remained firm.  Nevertheless, in \\norder to satisfy his parents’ wi shes, he agreed to become the King for one day.  He was ceremoniously crowned \\nKing with all the royal pomp.  Immediately after that, he left everything, renounced worldly life, and became a disciple \\nmonk of Lord Mahävir. \\nAt night, as a junior monk, he was given a place to sleep near the entrance.  During the night, other monks using \\nthe restrooms had to walk past his side.  Since no lamps are allowed in the upäshray (the monks’ residence), they \\nhappened to trample on his bed and sometimes their feet acciden tally touched his body in the dark.  Poor \\nMeghakumär could not sleep for the whole night.  He had grown up in luxuries.  Therefore, it was difficult for him to \\nbear the accidental kicking by the monks and his bed and body being smeared in dirt.  He felt that he could not bear \\nthat sort of a miserable life and decided to give up the life of a monk. \\nIn the morning, he went to Lord Mahävir to seek permission to return home.  Mahävir was aware of the discomforts \\nthat Meghakumär had faced the previous night and told him, “Meghakumär, you do not remember, but let me \\ndescribe to you the discomforts that you faced during your previous life.” \\n“In your previous life you were Meruprabhä, the King of elephants.

While playing, he saw a monk.  The monk’s name was Gautam \\nswämi, the chief disciple of Lord Mahävir.  He was barefoot and bald.  He was going from one house to another to \\nget alms (food).  Aimuttä ran to him and invited him to his palace to get food, saying this would make his moth er \\nand him very happy.  Gautam swämi agreed, and they went to the palace.  Aimuttä’s mother, Queen Shrimati, was \\nstanding on the balcony overlooking the garden.  She saw Gautam swämi and Aimuttä coming towards the palace.  \\nShe was very happy and came down to receive Gautam swämi.  She welcomed him with devotion and said, \\n“Matthaena Vandämi (my salutation to you).” She asked Aimuttä to go and get hi s favorite food to offer Gautam \\nswämi.  Aimuttä brought lädoos (sweets) and started putting them in the container even though Gautam swämi said \\nhe didn’t need that many.  Aimuttä was very happy to be offering food to the monk.  \\nAs Gautam swämi started to leave, Aimuttä said, “Your bag is heavy.  Please let me carry it for you.”  \\nGautam swämi said, “Aimuttä, I cannot give it to you because it can only be carried by those who have taken dikshä \\nand have become a monk.” \\nAimuttä asked, “What is dikshä?” \\nGautam swämi explained to him that when someone takes a vow of dikshä, he renounces his worldly life, his house, \\nhis family, and all other social and economic ties.  Then he becomes a monk.  People take Dikshä to avoid the \\naccumulation of bad karma and to attain liberation.  In normal everyday living, people are involved in various \\nactivities, which cause them to accumulate karmas.  On the other hand, monks and nuns avoid all the activities of \\nhouseholders in order to avoid accumulating these karmas. \\nAimuttä became curious and asked, “Gurudev, you do not commit sins! However, don’t you need to eat?  Don’t you \\nneed a place to live?  All these activities cause sins which acquire bad karmas.” \\nGautam swämi was pleased with the child’s interest to learn more.  So he explained, “We take food but we do not \\naccept food which is made especially for us.  We stay in a place but we do not  own it, and we do not stay there for \\nmore than a few days at a time.  We do not keep money, and we do not take part in any business or any organization.  \\nThus, as a monk, we do not do any activity that causes sins. \\nAimuttä said, “In that case, Gurudev, I want to take dikshä.” \\nAimuttä and Gautam swämi walked to the place where Lord Mahävir was giving a sermon.  Aimuttä joined the \\nothers to listen to his teachings.  In that sermon, Aimuttä learned what life is all about and what one can do if he or \\nshe wants to eliminate worldly suffering.  Aimuttä expressed his desire to become a monk to Lord Mahävir.  Lord \\nMahävir said, “We cannot let you take dikshä without your parents’ permission.” Aimuttä replied, “That is easy.  I \\nwill go home, get their permission, and come back.” \\nAimuttä went home.  He told his mother, “Mother, I want to take dikshä.  Remember you used to say that our \\nhousehold life is full of violence and causes sins?  Gautam swämi and Lord Mahävir also said the same.  I want to \\nbe free of sins.  Therefore, please give me permission to take dikshä.” \\nAimuttä’s mother was surprised by his words.  She was happy in her mind for his fear of sins and his desire to take \\ndikshä because she was a religious woman.  However, she wanted to be sure that Aimuttä understood what “taking \\ndikshä” meant.  So she said, “My son, to take dikshä is a very hard and disciplined life.  You will not have a mother \\nor a father to take care of you.  How will you be able to handle such suffering?”  \\nAimuttä said, “Mother, this household life also has a lot of suffering.  At least we know that as a monk the suffering \\nwill help destroy karmas and lead to liberation.” \\nHis mother was very happy to hear this.  However, she wanted to test Aimuttä’s determination further.  She said, \\n“Son, why are you in such a hurry?  Wait for a while.

Once it is acquired, it cannot be changed.  Karma that is indelible cannot be \\nchanged no matter how hard one tries. \\nBhagawän Mahävir suggested the following four alternatives to him: \\n1. There was a highly religious householder, known as Puniä Shrävak, in Räjgrihi.  He had given up all his \\ndesires and was leading a purely spiritual life.  For his livelihood he depended upon the innocent \\noccupation of making slivers out of cotton.  The Indian word for sliver is Puni.  He was therefo re known \\nas Puniä Shrävak.  He earned very little out of that but felt contented with whatever he could get.  He \\nused to spend most of his  time in sämäyik.  Bhagawän Mahävir suggested the King obtain the merit of \\none sämäyik from Puniä Shrävak.  The King thought that it was very simple.  He appr oached the man \\nand requested the merit of only one sämäyik.  Puniä said that he had no objection, but how could he do \\nthat since the merits as well as demerits happen to be non-transferable?  The King was disappointed. \\n2. The King had a maid servant named Kapilä .  She never gave alms to anyone.  Bhagawän Mahävir \\nsuggested to the King that he make her give alms on at least one day.  Accordingly, the King asked her \\nto do so.  She however replied that she would not even tak e anything in her hand for giving alms.  The \\nKing therefore arranged to tie a scoop to her hand and asked her to give alms.  While doing so, the maid \\nservant murmured that the King’s scoop is giving the alms, not me.  That plan also thus failed. \\n3. The King had a butcher named Kalsaurik who loved slaughtering animals.  Bhagawän Mahävir suggested \\nthe King to make sure that butcher Kalsaurik did not slaughter any animals for one day.  This seemed \\nvery easy to the King.  He ordered Kalsaurik to avoid killing the next day.  The butcher replied that he \\nwas so conditioned to kill that he could not even spend even one day without killing.  The King therefore \\nordered his men to hang him inverted in a well so that he could not undertake any actions of slaughtering.  \\nHowever, Kalsaurik was so conditioned that he imagined and drew the animals in the water of the well \\nand slaughtered them.  Thus the King could not stop him and that effort failed. \\n4. Bhagawän Mahävir then asked the King to observe the restraint of one Navkä rshi in which one is not \\nsupposed to eat or drink anything until 48 minutes after sunrise.  The King agreed to do so the next day.  \\nHowever, In the morning, he went to his favorite garden and saw the ripe berries.  He forgot the Navkärshi \\nand ate the berries.

He lived in a remote cave in  the Vaibhärgiri \\nhill near the city of Räjgrihi.  He was very clever in his profession and never left any traces of his burglary.  He and \\nhis wife, Rohini, had a son named Rohineya.  As Rohineya grew up, he learned his father’s profession and \\neventually became an expert burglar.  He even surpassed his father in intelligence and smartness.  It was almost \\nimpossible to recognize him when he was in disguise.  If someone pursued him, he could outrun them.  He robbed \\nthe rich and hid the treasures in the most unexpected and inaccessible places.  He extended help to the poor from \\nthe wealth that he accumulated.  Many of them felt grateful and were pleased with him.  Therefore, they were not \\nwilling to help government officials track him down. \\nLohkhur was now very old and could see that his life was coming to an end.  When he was on his deathbed, he \\ncalled Rohineya and said that he was very happy with the expertise that he had shown in committing burglary.  In \\norder to remain successful, he advised his son never to listen to the sermons of Lord Mahävir because his teachings \\nwere not conducive to their profession.  Rohineya promised his father he would abide by his advice.  \\nAfter Lohkhur died, Rohineya expanded his burglary so much that it became almost impossible for rich families to \\nensure the safety of their property when they went out.  They were constantly afraid that Rohineya would go to their \\nhome during their absence and take their jewelry  and other valuables.  Some people went to King Shrenik and \\nrequested him to take action to protect them from Rohineya’s burglaries since police officers had failed to do \\nanything about the matter.  The King therefore asked his most intelligent chief minister, Abhaykumär, to take charge \\nof arresting Rohineya. \\nOnce, while Rohineya was secretly on his way to Räjgrihi, he had to pass by the side of the Lord Mahävir’s assembly \\nhall.  He remembered his father’s advice of never listening to Lord Mahävir’s sermon.   He put his hands over his \\nears.  Unfortunately, at that moment he stepped on a sharp thorn that went deep into his foot.  He had to take his \\nhands off his ears in order to take out the thorn.  During this time, he heard the following words:  \\n  \\nThief Rohineya accidently overhears a sermon given by Bhagawän Mahävir'),\n",

However, the life of a heavenly being does not lead to ultimate \\nliberation, which provides eternal bliss and happiness.  Therefore, \\nheavenly beings crave a human life.” \\nBy that time Rohineya had removed the thorn from his foot.  He then covered his ears again with his hands and \\nproceeded towards the city. \\nIn the city, Abhaykumär had secretly posted trained soldiers in disguise at the gates and at all important locations.  \\nHe himself remained watchful.  When Rohineya entered the city, a trained soldier recognized him even though he \\nwas in the disguise of a farmer.  The soldier sent a message to Abhaykumär that an unidentified person had entered \\nthe city.  Abhaykumär became very alert.  As Rohineya passed by, Abhaykumär glanced at him from a secret place.  \\nHe recognized the burglar even in disguise and instructed his men to surround him.  Since Rohi neya was very \\nsmart, he quickly recognized the danger.  He ran towards the city wall.  Unfortunately for him, there were soldiers \\nnear the wall.  He was easily apprehended and put in jail. \\nThe next day he was presented in the royal court.  As Rohineya was in disguise, it was hard to identify him as the \\nburglar.  Abhaykumär was sure, but how could the accused be punished without proof of his identity?  When the \\nKing asked him about his identity, Rohineya replied that he was a farmer named Durgä chandra who belonged to \\nthe Shäligräm village.  He had come to Räjgrihi to visit the capital and was returning home when the watchmen \\napprehended him.  Rohineya had made arrangements for that assumed identity with the residents of the village.  \\nWhen inquiries were made in that village, the people confirmed what Rohineya had stated in court.  \\nAbhaykumär had to devise a plan for getting a confession from Rohineya regarding the burglaries.  He came to \\nknow that Rohineya was fond of drinks.  He therefore arranged to serve an excessive amount of wine to the thief.  \\nThe excessive wine made him unconscious.  While unconscious, Rohineya was cleaned, dressed in extravagantly \\nperfumed royal garments, and adorned with valuable jewelry.  He was then placed on a luxurious velvet bed of  \\nsandalwood on the top floor of a palatial building.  As Rohineya regained his consciousness, he saw himself in \\nheavenly surroundings.  There was a breathtaking view all around.  The walls, ceiling, and floor were crystalline.  \\nBeautiful maidens were wavin g scented air with diamond studded fans, soft serene music was heard in the \\nbackground, fairylike dancers were dancing in tune with the music, and divine musicians were getting ready for a \\nmusical concert. \\nRohineya could not make out where he was.  He asked one of the girls where he was and why they were all serving \\nhim so well.  The girl replied that he was their new King in heaven.  He had attained all the divine comforts, which \\nnow belonged to him.  He could live like Indra, the King of heaven, and enjoy life with heavenly damsels. \\n“Could this be true for a burglar like me?” he asked himself.  However, he then remembered that he was helpful to \\nthe poor and needy, and he was sure that god had been just.  “Or could this be the plan of Abhaykumär?” he thought \\nagain.  It was hard for him to decide what the truth really was.  He therefore thought it was best to wait and see.  \\nAfter a while, a luxuriously clad person entered with a golden staff and a book in his hand, “Is your new lord awake?” \\nhe asked one of the damsels.  The girl replied that their new lord had just woken up and that they were getting \\nready to celebrate his arrival in heaven by presenting the divine concert. “Let me make sure that all the preparations \\npertaining to his arrival have been  completed before you start the  concert, and let me also get some information \\nfrom him that the heavenly realm needs to know.” As he was saying this, he came to Rohineya.  Opening his book, \\nhe asked Rohineya to narrate his deeds from his previous life prior to enjoying the amenities of heaven.'),\n",

The person replied that \\nhe was a descendent of the person who  had built the well.  \\nSince he was poor, he was collecting a toll for using the \\nwell. \\nVimalshä was taken aback to hear that.  He asked himself, \\n“What would happen if one day some of my own \\ndescendants tried to collect a toll for the temple that I have \\nbuilt?” He shuddered at the idea and again asked himself \\nwhether it would be better in that case to remain without a \\nchild.  He went up and told his wife about the incident.  She \\nconcurred with his thinking.  At midnight when the goddess \\nasked them what they wanted, Shridevi replied that she did \\nnot want a child anymore.  Now, it was the turn of the \\ngoddess to be taken aback at the reply.  Vimalshä narrated what he had experienced and said that they wanted to \\nremain childless. \\nVastupäl and Tejpäl \\nTwo brothers, Vastupäl and Tejpäl, were min isters in the court of King Vir Dhavala in Gujarat.  Tejpäl was also a \\nvery outstanding commander of the army.  Both brothers made their name by their valor and faithfulness.  They \\nhelped the King to conquer enemies and maintain law and order in the kingdom.  Tejpäl’s wife, Anupamä devi, was \\na wise and smart woman who always helped her husband in family matters.  She was sweet spoken and a very \\nreligious and compassionate woman. \\nTejpäl had always respected her opinion.  Once, th e families of both the brothers and many others went on a \\npilgrimage.  They came to a small village.  This particular area was not regarded as very safe for the pilgrims \\nbecause the road was frequented with burglars.  Thinking that they might meet some bur glars on the way, the \\nbrothers decided to bury and hide their wealth in a nearby area.  They started digging a hole, but to their amazement, \\nthey unearthed a big pot of jewels and coins from the ground.  They simply did not know what to do with this wealth. \\nTejpäl asked Anupamä devi what they should do with this immense wealth.  Anupam ä devi had no hesitation in \\nreplying that this wealth had come from a deep trench, but the right place for it was on a high mountain.  This would \\nspread the glory of Jainism.  Thus, they decided to take it to the top of the mountain and spend it there. \\nShridevi and Vimalshä praying to \\nGoddess Ambikä'),\n",

Hence, Udayan thought about migrating to Gujarat. \\nAt that time, King Siddharäj of Gujarat had built a new town named Karnävati (Amdäväd) in the memory of his father \\nKarnadev.  Since Karnävati was a fast growing city, Udayan decided to move there.  He did not know anyone there \\nso he first went to the local Jain temple.

As she knew the newcomers were Jains, she took them home and treated \\nthem as her guests for a couple of days.  Then she gave them an old house for shelter.  Udayan settled there and \\nstarted a small business.  Luck favored him and within a short time he earned and saved enough to renovate the \\nold house.  While digging the ground, he came across a hidden treasure.  Since he was honest, he took the treasure \\nto Lachchhi and offered it to her because it belonged to her.  She declined to accept it, stating that since the property \\nhad been given to him, the treasure also belonged to him. \\nUdayan now had enough money to start a large-scale business.  He made lots of money, and in due course became \\nthe wealthiest man in Karnävati.  The state also recognized his status and gave him the position of the first citizen \\nof Karnävati.  In that capacity, he rendered valuable service to the people of Karnävati. \\nAt that time, the city of Khambhät (about 80 miles from Amdäväd) was the most lucrative seaport on the western \\ncoast of India.  Politicians competed with one another to get the position of governor of that city.  Due to the proven \\ncapability of Udayan, he was appointed governor of Khambhät in 1120 A.D.  He held that position for a fairly long \\nperiod.  Two major events have been attributed to him during his tenure as governor.  \\n\\uf0b7 At the suggestion of the queen mother, Minaldevi, he abolished the pilgrim tax of Bholäd \\n\\uf0b7 He helped Devchandra suri to initiate a five-year old boy, Chängdev, who had the potential to shine as a \\ngreat sage.  (Later on Chängdev became the great Jain Ächärya Shri Hemchandra) \\nHis loyalty to the King was unquestionable.  He hesitated to help Kumärpäl, who was roaming from town to town \\nhiding from King Siddharäj.  However, when Kumärpäl came to Khambhät in search of shelter, Hemchandrächärya \\nadvised Udayan to help him.  Since Udayan highly r espected the Ächärya, he agreed to hide Kumärpäl in his \\nbasement.  Shortly thereafter, King Siddharäj died and Kumärpäl became King of Gujarat.  King Kumärpäl kept \\nUdayan in his position as governor of Khambhät and later brought him to Pätan (capital city of Gujarat) to work as \\nhis trusted advisor. \\nUdayan had not forgotten how religion had helped him during his bad times.  He therefore used his wealth and \\nposition to promote Jainism.  As a token of his devotion to the faith, he constructed several Jain temp les.  Three of \\nthem are recorded in Jain history.  One was the temple known as Udayanvihär in Karnävati, another was Udävasahi \\nin Dholkä (nearby town of Karnävati), and the third one whose name is not recorded was in Khambhät.  \\nDuring the latter part of Udayan’s life, Kumärpäl sent him to subdue Sumvar, a notorious bandit in the Saurashtra \\nregion.  In that mission, he had to pass through Pälitänä.  He decided to go on a pilgrimage to Shatrunjay hill.  To \\ncommemorate the pilgrimage, his statue has been erecte d on a camel’s back in a small temple on the way to the \\nmain complex on the hill.  That place is now mistakenly known as Päp Punya Ni Bäri (window of good and bad \\nkarma). \\nAt that time, there was a wooden temple on the hill.  While Udayan was worshipping there, he saw a mouse take a \\nlit wick in its mouth and roam about.  Udayan recovered the wick from the mouse, but he realized that the temple \\ncould have been set on fire by a mouse.  He, therefore, vowed to construct a new temple there. \\nHe succeeded in his expedition against Sumvar, but he was badly wounded in combat, and his death was imminent.  \\nOn his death bed he told his sons about his vow to reconstruc t a new temple on  Shatrunjay hill.

It is located near the town of Pälitänä, about 140 \\nmiles southwest of Amdäväd, Gujarat.  There are nine temple complexes on the hill.  They are popularly known as \\nnine Tuks.  One of them is Chaumukhaji Tuk, located on the peak of the hill.  Here is an interesting story of the \\nconstruction of the temple complex there. \\nDuring the latter part of the 16th century when King Akbar, the great Moghul King, was ruling over India, there was \\na businessman named Savchand Jerä m in the town of Vanthali in the Saurashtra region of the Gujarat state.  He \\nowned a very large business.  He had many ships that used to export goods to Indonesia and other countries.  \\nDuring these voyages, they would buy merchandise at one place and sell it at another for profit. \\nOnce a fleet of 12 ships set sail with valuable merchandise.  After selling all their goods at a foreign port, they \\nreturned with valuable foreign merchandise.  On the way back, the fleet encountered a heavy storm and had to wait \\non an island.  Meanwhile, monsoons set in and the fleet was stranded on the island for a couple of months.  When \\nthe ships did not come back for a long time, Savchand’s shipping agents made all possible efforts to locate them.  \\nSince they did not find any trace of the fleet, they reported to Savchand that the ships were lost.  \\nThis was a heavy loss to Savchand.  He had invested a significant amount of money on the voyage and was \\nexpecting a handsome return by selling the merchandise that the ships were expected to bring back.  With the loss \\nof his ships, he faced an acute shortage of funds and it was hard for him to pay back his creditors.  As the news \\nabout the lost ships spread, people started talking about how Savchand had lost everything and his creditors would \\nhave to write off their dues. \\nThat set off a panic among his creditors.  In order to realize their dues, they began to present their claims.  Savchand \\nwas a highly religious and honest person.  He tried to pay back his creditors as much as he could with the resources \\nhe had left.  One of the creditors was the prince of Mängrol, a place not far from Vanthali.  He had deposited 100,000 \\nRupees in Savchand’s firm.  That was a substantial amount because one Rupee of that time would be worth about \\nRs.  250 today. \\nWhen the prince learned about the loss of Savchand’s ships, he also became impatient and called for the repayment \\nof his deposit.  Savchand could not raise such a large amount so quickly.  He requested the prince to wait while he \\ntried to raise the money.  The prince, however, insisted on getting the amount immediately.  Savchand’s name and \\ncredit were at stake.  In order to maintain his credit, he had to find a way to pay the prince.  \\nAt that time, there was a businessman named Somchand Amichand in the city of Amdäväd.  Savchand did not have \\nany trade connection with him, but he had heard about Somchand’s firm and knew Somchand to be a very noble \\ngentleman.  An idea occurred to him.  He thought of satisfying the prince by gi ving him a promissory note which \\nwould be honored by Somchand’s firm.  The prince agreed to that form of payment.  Savchand wrote a promissory \\nnote payable to the prince by Somchand’s firm without Somchand’s permission.  Since he had no right to write this, \\nhe was overcome with sadness and guilt while preparing it and tears began to roll down his face.  A few tear drops \\nfell on the document and smeared the promissory note.  Then, with a heavy heart, Savchand handed the note to \\nthe prince and requested him to cash it with Somchand’s firm. \\nThe prince did not lose any time.  He immediately proceeded towards Amdäväd, and upon arriving presented the \\npromissory note to Somchand’s firm.  The accountant took the note in his hand and asked his men to look for \\nSavchand’s account.  The men searched their books, but they did not find any account in the name of Savchand.  \\nThe men reported that Savchand had no trade connections with their firm.  The accountant went to Somchand and \\ninformed him that he had received a promis sory note of exchange from Savchand of Vanthali which, being unduly \\ndrawn, could not be honored. \\nSomchand was puzzled to learn that.  He knew Savchand’s firm by name and was aware that it was a well reputed \\nbusiness organization of Vanthali.  He could not make out why Savchand would have drawn the note for such a \\nlarge amount when Somchand did not have any trade links with his firm.  He looked at the note again and noticed \\nthe letters smeared by Savchand’s tears.  He could make out from the water spots that  Savchand must have been \\nin a very embarrassing position and must have drawn the note out of sheer desperation.'),\n",

It was now his turn to \\nreciprocate.  What good was his wea lth if he could not extend a helping hand to a noble man in distress?  He, \\ntherefore, decided to oblige and asked the accountant to honor the note.  The accountant was confused and asked, \\n“From which account should the amount be debited?” Somchand instructed the accountant to debit it to his personal \\naccount. \\nThe note was accordingly accepted, and the amount was paid to the prince.  The prince did not actually need the \\nmoney and had asked for payment because of his doubt about the financial stability of Sav chand.  When the note \\nwas honored, he felt reassured about Savchand’s credibility and repented for insisting upon the return of his deposit.  \\nOn his way home, he went to Savchand and told him that he had received the amount from Amdäväd.

As Savchand repeatedly insisted on repaying the amount of his promissory \\nnote, Somchand explained that he was unable to accept the amount because his books did not show any amount \\ndue from Savchand.

He has made \\npriceless contributions to Jain philosophy and literature.  He was a great philosopher, a brilliant poet, social reformer, \\na thinker, and a self-realized saint.  Mahatma Gandhi was highly influenced by Shrimad’s spiritual life.  Shrimad’s \\nwritings come from his experiences of life, and his teachings are widely followed by many Jain and Hindu aspirants \\nseeking spiritual awakening and self-realization. \\nBirth and Childhood \\nShrimad Räjchandra was born on the auspicious full -\\nmoon (Dev -Diwäli) of the month of Kärtik, 1924 V.S .  \\n(November 9, 1867) in Vävania , Morbi distric t, Gujarat.  \\nHis parents were Rav jibhai and Dev bä.  He was named \\nLaxminandan at birth, but after four years his name was \\nchanged to Raichand.  Later he became famous by the \\nname of Räjchandra. \\nRäjchandra’s father and grandfather followed the \\nVaishnav (Hindu) religion.  They were devotees of  Lord \\nKrishna.  His mother, Dev bä, was from a Jain family.  \\nThus, the child Räjchandra was brought up under the \\nunified culture of Jainism and Hinduism. \\nAs a child, Räjchandra was deeply interested in reading \\nvarious books.  Once he read the Jain pratikraman sutras \\nand was touched by the feelings of kindness to animals \\nand the expression of sincere forgiveness from each other \\nduring daily pratikraman rituals and the paryushan \\nfestival.  He was drawn closer to the Jain faith because of \\nthe emphasis it places on self -knowledge, self -control, \\npenance, renunciation, detachment from worldly affairs, \\nand meditation.  As a seeker of ultimate truth, Shrimad \\ncame to the conclusion that the philosophy and culture of \\nthe Jain religion was of the highest order of truth and \\nequanimity. \\nAn incident took place when he was seven years old that \\nchanged the course of his life.  An adult acquaintance, \\nShri Amichandbhai, died of a serpent -bite.  Young \\nRäjchandra asked his grandfather, “What does it mean to die?” His loving grandfather explained, “His soul  has left \\nthe body and he will no longer be able to eat, talk, or move.  His body will be burnt outside the village.” Räjchandra \\nsaw the dead body being burnt and slipped into deep contemplation.  Suddenly, as if a veil lifted, he recalled his \\npast lives.  With this experience he realized the pains of repeated births and deaths from one life to another.  This \\nincidence became a major spiritual awakening point in his life to free himself from the bondage of karma and the \\nlife cycle of pain and misery. \\nRäjchandra started his schooling at the age of seven.  With his exceptional ability to remember exactly what he saw \\nor heard or read once, he was able to complete the seven-year elementary school education in a mere two years.  \\nThe village school provided only s even years of education and hence his formal education came to an end.  \\nShrimad Räjchandra'),\n",

After his elementary education, he worked in his \\nfather’s shop and conducted the business honestly and sincerely.  \\nHe composed his first poem at the age of eight and started \\nwriting poems and articles related to social issues for \\npublication in the local newsletters.  Despite his young age \\nhe wrote serious articles on social reform subjects like the \\nneed for improving female  literacy rates, about child \\nmarriages, and about the display of wealth by the rich.  He \\nalso composed poems with nationalistic zeal. \\nAt a very young age, he had the supernatural ability to \\nforesee what was likely to happen and he helped people by \\nsaving them from possible disasters.  By the time he was \\n18, he had become a very proficient astrologer.  He was able \\nto identify books merely by touching them and know the \\ntaste of food without tasting it.  Along with developing all \\nthese extraordinary abilities,  he became very \\ncompassionate towards all living beings and  a strong \\npromoter of non-violence. \\nFamily \\nAt the age of 20  in 1988 A.D. , Räjchandra married \\nZabakben.  Zabakben was the daughter of Shri Popatlälbhai \\nJagjivandäs, the elder brother of Shri Reväshankarbhai who \\nlater became Shrimad’s business partner.  They had four \\nchildren.  Th eir two sons were Shri Chhaganlä l and Shri \\nRatiläl.  Their two daughters were Smt.  Javalben and Smt.  \\nKäshiben.  Shrimad had a younger brother named Shri \\nMansukhbhai. \\nShrimad Räjchandra became a partner in a gemstone business in Mumbai at the age of 20.  He was absolutely \\nethical, honest, and compassionate in all his business dealings.  In a very short time his business flourished because \\nof his wisdom and business insight.  His regard for truth, adherence to high moral values, and firmness to do what \\nwas right inspired many others.  In 1899 A.D., he totally retired from business at the age of 31.  \\nPower of Avadhän (Multi-Tasking) \\nAt the age of 17, Shrimad had observed someone performing eight different tasks simultaneously, known as Ashtä-\\nvadhäni, in Gujarati.  He studied the method, and the next day he was able to perform twelve tasks.  He soon \\nimproved his performance to be able to manage 52 avadhäns.  When he was 19, he w as invited to perform his \\navadhäns at a public meeting in Mumbai in the presence of the Bombay Chief Justice and other dignitaries.  He \\nsuccessfully performed 100 avadhäns, known as Shatävdhän. \\nThe 100 tasks included a variety of activities like playing cards, playing chess, counting the bell chimes, completing \\nmathematical calculations, composing poems with different themes and specified sets of words, and arranging the \\norder of words from 16 different languages which included English, Greek, Latin and Ara bic (note that Shrimad’s \\nformal study included only Gujarati up to Grade 7 of elementary school). \\nThis was an unbelievable feat, and the performance was given much publicity in all the major newspapers like the  \\n“Times of India” and “Pioneer”.  Shrimad was invited to go to Europe and demonstrate his extraordinary talents.  \\nThis would have meant more fame and substantial material gain.  However, he declined the offer because it would \\nbe extremely difficult to stay in Europe as per Jain religious standards.  He would also be distracted from his main \\nobjective of spiritual progress. \\nBy the time he was 20, his fame had spread throughout India, and he realized that he was achieving only material \\nbenefits for his amazin g powers, which was not what he wanted from his life.  He gave up all such activities \\nShrimad Räjchandra multi-tasking at \\nage 19'),\n",

True to its name, it deals with subjects that l ead towards the path of liberation.  It is written in a simple \\nand easy to understand language, but explains the Jain religion in the finest detail.  Its 108 lessons were composed \\nin three days! \\nÄtmasiddhi-shästra is an epic poem and the prime jewel composed by Shrimad in Gujarati in 1896 while he was in \\nNadiäd, a town near Amdäväd.  On one auspicious evening, he composed 142 stanzas of Ätmasiddhi-shästra in a \\nsitting of less than 90 minutes.  The fact that Shrimad composed such comprehensive and all-inclusive work within \\nsuch a short time can give us a clue of the depth of spiritual wealth he possessed.  \\nThe subject matter of Ätmasiddhi-shästra is the scientific characterization of the six fold truths of soul: its existence, \\nits eternity, doer of its karma, the impact of karma on it, the nature of the pure consciousness, and its potential for \\nattaining liberation from karma.  It describes the Jain philosophy comprehensi vely and also shows how \\nAnekäntaväda allows Jainism to encompass all other Indian faiths.  Many scholars have written an elegant \\ncommentary on the “Ätmasiddhi-shästra”. \\n“Apurva Avasar” was his last major compilation.  It is the most divine poem in which Shrimad expresses the fourteen \\nstages of spiritual progress for ultimate liberation.  Apurva Avasar was incorporated into the prayer book in \\nGandhiji’s Äshram. \\nThe complete works of S hrimad contain more than thirty -five poems and almost 950 letters which were written to \\nvarious people who came  in contact with him.  They are compiled in a text called “Vachanämrit”.  A high level of \\nspirituality is evident in his writings.  If one delves deeper into his literature, one will notice that his writings provide  \\nexcellent discourses for attaining self-realization leading to liberation. \\nMahatma Gandhi was very impressed by Shrimad’s spirituality and lifestyle.  He accepted Shrimad as his spiritual \\nguide with great respect and reverence.  When Gandhiji was in South Africa, he was under intense pressure fr om \\nhis Christian and Muslim friends to adopt their faith.  He wrote to Shrimad for guidance.  Shrimad’s guidance \\nconvinced him of how his own faith, Hinduism, would ensure his spiritual progress.  Gandhiji has written reverently \\nabout Shrimad in his autobi ography and has paid glorious tribute to him on several occasions.  He often revealed \\nthat he learnt compassion for all beings and non -violence from Shrimad.  According to him, Shrimad’s life and \\nspiritual writings impacted him more than Tolstoy and Ruskin. \\nSpiritual Progress \\nShrimad did not have a spiritual teacher in his life.  At the age of seven, when he was able to recall his past lives, \\nhe clearly remembered his association with Lord Mahävir in a previous life.  \\nIn 1891 A.D., at the age of 23, Shrimad realized samyag darshan.  He continued to enhance his progress by slowly \\ndetaching himself from the material world, deeply studying scriptures, strengthening virtues, refraining from worldly \\npleasures, and remaining in meditation for longer durations.  He started to stay at lonely places outside Mumbai for \\nmore than a month at a time.  In the beginning, there were many obstacles in his way because he needed to perform \\nhis duties as a house holder and as a businessman. \\nFrom 1896 A.D., he often spent several months in isolation in the woods of Uttarsandä , Idar, and Kavithä , where \\nhe would eat only one meal during the day and sleep very little.  He spent his time in deep meditation and attained \\na highly enlightened state of self-realization at the age of 28. \\nHe retired totally from business in 1899 at the age of 31 and requested that his mother permit him to renounce the \\nworldly life permanently and become a monk.  Unfortunately, his mother denied him out of love and affection.'),\n",

He was \\na native of Sailä, a town near Rajkot.  Based on his request, Shrimad composed the epic poem “Ätmasiddhi-\\nshästra” so that it would be easier to memorize.

Shrimad entrusted him to copy scriptural works and his letters be cause of his \\nexceptional memory.  He and Shrimad’s younger brother, Mansukhbhai, were responsible for recovering \\nShrimad’s letters and writings and publishing them.

He presented these teachings in simple \\nGujarati and Hindi in both prose and poetry forms.  As we stud y Shrimad’s writings in depth, we find that he made \\nan enormous effort to shed new light on true spirituality.  He succeeded in reforming blind faith with real spiritual \\nawakening. \\nHis biggest contribution is to point out the mistakes most people make in following a teacher based on the external \\nconduct and dress code.  The spiritual journey led by a wrong teacher leads the disciple to extended life cycles of \\nmisery and pain.  On the other hand, when an aspirant is able to know and follow the teachings of a  true teacher \\n(sadguru), he will be able to attain true freedom and liberation. \\nMorality: \\nGood manners, good activities, and good behavior are the roots of holiness.  \\nAll living beings are seen as equal.  Therefore, do not cause pain to any soul, nor extort  work from any soul \\nbeyond their ability and capacity. \\nHuman life: \\nAll living beings long for permanent happiness, and there is no exception to this.  This desire can be  \\nfulfilled only in a human life.  Yet human beings choose unhappiness.  This is due to his illusionary state \\n (Mohaniya karma - Mithyätva) in which he sees happiness in worldly desires and possessions.  \\nNon-attachment to Worldly Affairs (Vairägya): \\nDetachment from worldly and materialistic affairs and family relationships is defined as Vairägya, and \\nachieving it is essential for eternal happiness. \\nTrue renunciation is always followed by the true knowledge of the self or the soul.  Without true renunciation, \\na person will not be able to gain the true knowledge of the soul.  If one stops only at the stage of renunciation \\nand there is no desire for true knowledge, his/her human life would be in vain.  \\nKnowledge and Wisdom: \\nThrough proper knowledge, we are able to know the forms and qualities of the substances of the universe.  \\nThe Jain scripture, Uttarädhyayan Sutra, indicates that “Knowledge is like a needle with a thread.  Just like \\na needle with a thread in it does not get lost, a person with knowledge will not lose the right religious path in \\nthis world.” \\nIt is the true knowledge with which  an external feeling is controlled, attachment for life, family  and worldly \\npleasures is decreased, and the truth is revealed. \\nIf you know yourself, you know the whole world.  If you do not know yourself, your knowledge is worthless.'),\n",

The Columbus Hall of the Art Institute of Chicago was \\noverflowing with over 3, 000 delegates of different nations and religions.  It was the opening day of t he Parliament \\nof World Religions Conference, the first such conference ever organized in the history of mankind.  The aim of the \\nconference was to impart the knowledge of different religions to the world, to promote a feeling of fraternity between \\nfollowers of diverse religious persuasions, and to pave the way for world peace.  The conference lasted for 17 days. \\nTwo young men among them, with their Indian costumes and turbans, drew special attention from the public.  One \\nwas the world famous Swämi Vivekänanda, who represented Hinduism, and the other was Shri Virchand Räghavji \\nGandhi, who represented Jainism.  They made such an impact at the Parliament of Religions with their impressive \\nspeeches and personality  that, they both were requested to prolong their stay in the U.S.  and continue giving \\nspeeches in different cities after the conference was over. \\nShri Virchand Gandhi, a young man of twenty-nine, impressed the delegates not only by his eloquence, but also by \\nthe sheer weight of his scholarship.  The impartiality of his outlook and his oratorical skills fascinated the delegates \\nat the conference.  An American newspaper wrote, “Of all the Eastern scholars, it was this youth whose lectures on \\nJain faith and conduct were listened to with great interest and attention.” \\nShri Virchand R.  Gandhi was born on August 25, 1864 in Mahuvä, near Bhävnagar, Gujarat.  After his primary and \\nsecondary education in Bhävnagar, he joined Elphinstone College in Mumbai.  He graduated and obtained a B.A.  \\nDegree with honors from the University of Bombay in 1884.  He was probably the first graduate amongst the Jains \\nat that time.  He was also a student of Buddhism, Vedanta Philosophy, Yoga, Christianity and Western philosophy.  \\nHe had also done a comparative study of various philo sophies, which equipped him for talks on various subjects \\nwith confidence.  He had command over fourteen languages including Gujarati, Hindi, Bengali, English, Präkrit, \\nSanskrit, and French. \\nShri Gandhi became the first honorary secretary of the Jain Assoc iation of India in 1885 at the age of 21.  As \\nsecretary, he worked very hard for the abolition of the poll tax levied on pilgrims to Mount Shatrunjay, the most \\nsacred place of Jain religion at Pälitänä. To protest against the ruler .in those days was to invite severe punishment \\nand even death.  He prepared a case to compromise.  He made a strong representation to Lord Ray, the governor \\nof Bombay, and Colonel Watson, the political agent, and eventually the poll tax was abolished in place of a fixed \\npayment of Rs. 15,000 per year to the ruler for looking after the safety of the pilgrims and the holy place.  \\nIn 1891 Mr. Bod am, an Englishman, set up a factory for slaughtering pigs and maki ng tallow out of them at \\nSametshikhar, another holy place of Jain pilgrimage near Calcutta in the state of Bihar.  Shri Virchand Gandhi went \\nall the way to Calcutta to stop the killing of pigs at the holy place.  He stayed there for six months, learned Bengali, \\nprepared his case against the factory, and ultimately g ot this verdic t issued: “Samets hikhar is a place of Jain \\npilgrimage, and nobody else has any right to interfere there.” He got the factory to close down.  \\nShri Virchand Gandhi was a great social reformer at a very young age.  At the age of 22, he wrote long essays to \\nremove evil social customs and continuously fought against them and was successful in eradicating many of them. \\nShri Virchand Gandhi sailed to the U.S.  along with Swämi Vivekänanda to attend the Parliament of World Religion \\nConference in 1893.  He stayed in the United States for about two years after the conference and gave lectures in \\ncities such as Chicago, Boston, New York, and Washington.  He also visited England, France, Germany, and other \\nplaces in Europe.  In foreign countries, he wore a long and loose  kurta, a white shawl on his sh oulder, a golden \\nbordered kathiäwädi turban on his head, and country shoes.  This external appearance bore the imprint of India.  \\nHe delivered more than 535 lectures on Jainism, yoga, Indian systems of philosophy, Indian culture, occultism, and \\nspiritualism.

He was a fair and just King, known for his devotion to truth \\nand non-violence.  On top of Mount Ratnasringa, there was a beautiful temple dedicated to Bhagawän Rishabhadev, \\nthe first Tirthankar.  Duri ng the month of Chaitra, on the day of the full moon, people came from far to visit and \\nworship at the temple.  Once,  King Hansa decided to visit the temple.  He asked his council of ministers to look \\nafter the kingdom during his prolonged absence and left  with members of the royal household on this spiritual \\nmission. \\nA few days after King Hansa departed, King Arjun attacked the city.  In spite of putting up a strong fight, King \\nHansa’s army was defeated, and many of the generals lost their lives on the bat tlefield.  King Arjun gained control \\nof the palace and the treasury.  King Arjun occupied the royal throne and enforced his authority over the entire \\nkingdom. \\nKing Hansa heard the story of thei r defeat on the way to the temple.  The King’s courtiers were very upset and \\nadvised him to return to the city.  The King said, “I have given up control of the kingdom and as we are on a spiritual \\nmission, that is what we should be thinking about.  So let us keep going to the temple.” The King’s courtiers were \\nunhappy about the King’s decision and worried about the safety of their families at home.  One by one, they all \\ndropped out until only one umbrella bearer remained with the King. \\nOn the way to the temple, they had to pass through the forest.  The King took off his royal dress and jewelry and \\ngave them to his servant.  While passing through the forest, the servant was separated from the King. \\nAs the King was walking, a deer ran in f ront of him and disappeared.  Right after that, a hunter came running with \\na bow in his hand and asked the King if he had seen the deer.  The King knew that if he told the truth, the deer \\nwould be killed.  He decided not to answer the question and instead kept talking about irrelevant things.  He said \\nthat he came from Räjpur.  The hunter asked him again about the deer, and he answered that he was the King.  \\nThe hunter was very upset with his answers and left in anger. \\nBy now, the King was tired and decided to rest under a tree.

If they did, they would receive a big reward.  King Hansa thought for a \\nmoment and said, “I am King Hansa.  Carry out your duty as told by you r King.” After saying that, he closed his \\neyes, stood in meditation, and started reciting the Namaskär Mangal Sutra. \\nAt once, a deva appeared and said, “Oh King!

Non-violence, non-absolutistic \\nviewpoint (Anekäntaväda), and non -possessiveness/ non -attachment (Aparigraha) are fundamental \\nprinciples of Jainism. Non-violence strengthens the proper conduct of every individual, non -absolutistic \\nview stre ngthen the right thinking of every individual, and non -possessiveness strengthens the \\ninterdependence of all existence and provides harmony in society. If we observe these three principles \\nin their true spirit, peace and harmony can certainly be attained within us as well as in the world. \\nAlthough not fully introduced to the western world, Jainism is India’s oldest living religion. The basic \\nprinciples of Jainism are scientific and the ‘truths’ presented in the Jain scriptures are universal; however, \\ntheir interpretations and applications have to be done in the context of time and space in which we find \\nourselves. \\nIn English-speaking countries where many Jains have settled permanently such as USA, Canada, UK, \\nand Africa, children do not have access to Jain educational material. In an attempt to make Jain principles \\nknown globally, the educational material must be made widely available in English. It is also necessary \\nto publish Jain literature and educational material in a variety of media (i.e. books, videos , cassettes, \\nCDs, DVDs, and web deployment) for English -speaking people interested in Jain philosophy, religion, \\nand scriptures. JAINA Education committee has taken up this task. \\nThe JAINA Education Committee is pleased to present a set of JAINA Education books for students of \\nall ages interested in learning Jainism. These books are grouped into four age levels: Level 1 for \\nelementary, Level 2 for middle school, Level 3 for high school, and Level 4 for college students. The \\nentire list of JAINA Education Series Books is listed in this section. \\nEvery edition of the Päthashälä books go through minor/major revisions incorporating suggestions \\nreceived from various Päthashälä teachers, educators, and students from different centers.  \\nThe education committee members are Jain Päthashälä teachers of various centers and they have spent \\ncountless hours in the preparation /review of this material. Great care has been taken to present the \\nmaterial in a non-sectarian way and incorporate the uniqueness of every Jain sect. Significant effort has \\nbeen made to maintain consistency in the spellings of Jain words. Many youth s have helped us in \\nimproving the English grammar in these books. \\nThe Jain Story Book (JES 202 – Level 2) was originally compiled and coordinated by Pradip an d \\nDarshana Shah of Chicago, Illinois  in 2004 . A great deal of effort has been taken by them for the \\npreparation of the material. Significant time was spent in the selection of the stories. The stories were \\nselected from the previous version of JAINA Education story book, the story book of Shri Manubhai Doshi, \\nand few of the stories wer e gathered from various sources  and we are grateful to the authors and \\npublishers for being able to use their work liberally. We are thankful to Anita Parikh of Connecticut for the \\ndesign and layout of this book. \\nWe needed to modify the popular versions of certain stories because we felt that they violated the basic \\nprinciples of the Jain religion and in some cases they were not conducive to American culture which \\ntreats men and women equally. \\nThe following stories have been modified from their popular version: \\n1. Chandanbälä – \\nThe popular story indicates that Chandanbälä had no tears when ascetic Mahävir came to her \\nhouse for Gochari and then he turn ed around.  Immediately Chandanbälä started crying and \\nMahävir turn around and accepted Gochari.  This explanation violates the monk’s conduct with \\nregards to acceptance rules of Gochari. Monks cannot go back to the same house twice for'),\n",

However, in Upadeshmälä \\nDoghatti Tika of Shri Ratnaprabhsoori translated by Acharya Shri Hems ägarsoori on page 43 \\n(eLibrary book 008467) indicates that the tears were present when a scetic Mahävir saw \\nChandanbälä.  He accepted the Gochari of Adadana Bakla in his hand. \\n2. Aimuttä muni \\nThe popular story states that at the early age of 7 years, Aimuttä muni sincerely repented for his \\nmistake and attained Keval-jnän.  While Jain literature indicates the person should be at least 8 \\nyears of age before he is eligible to take Dikshä.  In Rushimandalstav Prakaran, Aimuttä muni \\nrepents at the age of 13 remembering the earlier incidence and attains Keval-jnän. \\n3. Shälibhadra \\nThe popular story states that before renunciation, Shälibhadra decided to give-up one wife every \\nday, and at the end of 32 days he would become monk.  This indicates that he was treating his \\n32 wives as his property, which is against Jain principles and the American culture.  We have \\nmodified the story indicating that he decided to renounce the world over the period of a month. \\n4. Bhagawän Mallinäth \\nThe popular story states that Bhagawän Mallinäth, in a previous life as a monk named Mahäbal \\nwas secretly observing longer penances without informing the other monks.  In essence, he was \\ndeceiving the other monks.  This is the reason Bhagawän Mallinäth was born as a female.  This \\nis against American culture. \\nJain scriptures are written using Devanägari characters. To pronounce these characters in English \\ncorrectly, it is n ecessary to put various diacritical marks on some English vowels and consonants. \\nHowever, most internet browsers and word processors do not display and print all these transliterated \\ncharacters. The main objective of these books is to teach the principles of Jainism to Jain youth and lay \\npeople who do not have the knowledge of this transliteration convention. As a result, a simplified \\ndiacritical mark scheme has been adopted for this series. The transliteration used here is neither \\nauthentic nor totally consistent. While it will serve the purpose of learning Jain principles, this book should \\nnot be used for learning correct pronunciations. \\nPlease note that the JAINA Education committee members are Jain Päthashälä teachers and are not \\nJain scholars. Hence, you may find some errors in the presentation. Certain items may be applicable to \\none Jain sect and not applicable to other Jain sects. Please pardon us for any mistakes, oversights, \\nunderstatements, or overstatements in the material. We request you to use an d review the material \\nobjectively and provide suggestions to enable us to incorporate them easily in future revisions. \\nIn line with Jain Philosophy, the JAINA education book series is not copyrighted.

He therefore planned to renounce his worldly \\nlife, his possessions, and worldly pleasures in search of true spiritual happiness.  However, he knew that his \\nparents would be very sad and hurt if he did this so he decided not to renounce his current life w hile they \\nwere alive.  His parents passed away when he was 28 years old.  He was now ready to renounce his worldly \\nlife by giving up his family, friends, and possessions; but again postponed it for two more years at the request \\nof his older brother, Nandivardhan. \\nPrince Vardhamän led a very simple life for one year.  When he had exactly one more year of a householder’s \\nlife left, he began donating all of his belongings and wealth \\nto the needy and to those who came to him.  Every day he \\nwould donate many gold coins, jewels, precious stones, \\nand clothes.  This unique and unprecedented charity \\nimpressed upon the minds of the people that “Charity is a \\ndouble blessing - it blesses those who give as well those \\nwho receive”. \\nAt the end of the year marked by generosity, Prince \\nVardhamän attained perfect “Aparigrahatva”, freedom \\nfrom attachments and possessions.  He was now fully \\nprepared for the life o f a monk.  His elder brother made \\nelaborate preparations for the initiation and the country \\nwas filled with great excitement.  Indra and other heavenly \\ngods participated in the ceremony.  Gold and silver \\npitchers were filled with water from various holy pl aces.  \\nThe prince was bathed with the holy waters, anointed with \\nperfumed pastes, dressed in royal garments, and decked \\nwith precious ornaments.

And thus, with all the eight karmas completely annihilated, \\nhis soul soared high, reached the pinnacle of Loka and went to the \\npermanent abode of Siddhas, never to return again.  And thus \\nBhagawän Mahävir achieved the highest goal: liberation. \\nFuneral Rites performed by Heavenly Gods and \\nHuman Beings \\nAt the time of Bhagawän Mahävir’s nirväna, eighteen rulers of \\nvarious states were present.  When the light of his knowledge \\nwas extinguished from the world, they lit numerous earthen \\nlamps, beginning the tradition of the Festival of Lights known \\nas Deepävali or Diwäli.  Upon Bhagawän Mahävir  achieving \\nthe fifth Kalyänak, Indra and the other gods flew down to earth \\nto celebrate.  They bathed his body with holy waters, applied \\nsandal paste, dressed the body in rich garments and adorned \\nit with a crown and other ornaments.  He was carried in a \\npalanquin. Millions joined  the procession to pay their last \\nhomage.  There was solemn music accompanied on musical \\ninstruments.  The palanquin was placed on a pyre of fragrant \\nsandalwood; after the final prayers were offered, the fire was \\nlit.  Later, perfumed water was sprinkled t o extinguish the fire \\nand the gods carried the molars and the bones to heaven. \\nBhagawän Mahävir’s sermons were compiled orally by his immediate disciples in 12 books in the form of sutras.  \\nThese books are called Anga Ägam Sutras.  Later, several learned Ächäryas (Shruta Kevali monks) compiled many \\nmore books to further explain the Anga Ägam Sutras.  All these books are called Ägams or Ägam Sutras and are \\nconsidered the scriptures of the Jain religion.  These Ägam Sutras were passed on orally to future gene rations of \\nascetics, although over the course of time, some of the Ägam Sutras were lost.  Approximately one thousand years \\nlater, the memorized Ägam Sutras were organized and recorded on tädpatris (palm leaves used as paper to \\npreserve records for future references). \\nBhagawän Mahävir preached that Right Faith (Samyag -Darshan), Right Knowledge (Samyag -Jnän), and Right \\nConduct (Samyag-Chäritra).

In this way, he preached the gospel of \\nuniversal love. \\nMahävir rejected the concept of God as a creator, protector, and destroyer of the universe.

The Jain time cycle has no beginning or end.  It continuously migrates from periods of progress to \\nperiods of decline.  According to Jain tradition, a period of progress, known as an Utsarpini or an ascending order, \\nis marked with all-around improvement, including longer lifespan, greater prosperity, and overall happiness.  On the \\nother hand, a period of decline, known as an Avasarpini or a descending order, is marked with all -around \\ndeterioration and decline such as a shorter life span and general gloom.  These two periods together make one -\\ntime cycle. \\nEach Utsarpini and Avasarpini is divided into six eras called Äräs, meaning the spokes of a wheel.  We are currently \\nin the fifth Ärä of the Avasarpini period.  It is also known as Dusham or Dukham (Unhappy) Ärä.  Hindu tradition \\ncalls it Kaliyuga. \\nUntil the end of the third Ärä of the current Avasarpini, people led a natural and simple life.  The population was \\nsmall and nature provided all the necessities for human beings; trees provided shelter and enough leaves and bark \\nfor covering their bodies.  With the help of the branches, they could erect huts for protection from rain and extreme \\nweather.  When they felt hungry, they could pick their food from the trees and bushes.  There was enough flowing \\nwater for cleaning their bodies and quenching their thirst.  As such, there was no struggle for existence or rivalry for \\nsurvival, and people spent their lives in peace. \\nThe people lived in tribes, each of which had a le ader \\nknown as a Kulkar or King.  Towards the end of the third \\nÄrä, there lived a Kulkar named Näbhiräyä who managed \\nhis community  peacefully.  In due course, his beautiful \\nwife, Queen Marudevi, gave birth to Rishabh. \\nThe world’s conditions started changing  after Rishabh \\nwas born.  There was an increase in population and \\nnature no longer remained as bountiful as it used to be.  \\nThis gave rise to a struggle for the acquisition and \\naccumulation of the necessities of life; the emotions of \\njealousy and envy arose.  Näbhiräyä, as the leader of the \\ncommunity, tried to restrain the struggle to the utmo st \\npossible extent.  As Rishabh  grew to be a bold, \\nintelligent, and enthusiastic young man, Näbhiräyä \\nentrusted the management of the kingdom to him. \\nRishabh was a visionary, a thinker, and an inventor.  He \\nforesaw that the struggle for survival would become \\nworse unless some system of producing the necessities \\nof life was created.  He realized that people could make \\nan effort to obtain what they needed from nature inst ead \\nof relying exclusively on natural bounties.

Thus, a social order evolved and Rishabh, as the first \\nacknowledged ruler in human society, came to be known \\nas King Rishabhadev.  During his long rule, he laid down \\nequitable rules and regulations for ensuring peace and \\nsafety within his realm. People of his kingdom’s loved King \\nRishabhadev for providing peace and happiness. \\nRishabhadev had 100 sons; the eldest two were called \\nBharat and Bähubali.  He also had two daughters, Brähmi \\nand Sundari.  These four children were experts in different \\narts and crafts.  Bharat became a brave warrior and a \\ncapable ruler.  Jain literature indicates that India was \\nnamed “Bhärat” after him.  Bähubali, true to his name \\n(Bähu means arm and Bali means mighty), was known for \\nhis exceptional arm strength.  Brähmi evolved the art of \\nwriting and developed the Brähmi script in which most of \\nthe scriptures were written.  Her sister, Sundari, cultivated \\nan exceptional talent in mathematics. \\nRishabhadev was proud and happy of his achievements \\nand felt content with his ruler ship.  However, one day an \\nincident occurred that changed his way of thinking.  As he \\nwas watching a dance, the dancer suddenly collapsed and \\ndied.  Rishabhadev was very disturbed by the sudden \\ndeath and began pondering over the death of the dancer.  \\nHe soon realized that every phenomenon and every \\nsituation in the universe undergoes changes—no situation \\nremains permanent. \\nUpon this realization, Rishabhadev (Ädinäth) decided to renounce worldly life in search of lasting happiness.  He \\ngave Bharat the city of Vinitä, entrusted the city of Taxshilä to Bähubali, and distributed the other parts of his vast \\nkingdom to the remaining 98 sons.  He then renounced all his possessions and became a  monk in search of the \\nultimate truth.  Four thousand of his associates and followers joined him in renouncing worldly life.  \\nAs a monk, Rishabhadev traveled from place to place.  He remained in a state of continuous meditation, not thinking \\nof food or water.  However, his deep meditation meant that he could not guide his followers on how they should live \\ntheir lives as monks.  His followers were unable to fast like him, but they did not want to go back.  They became \\nconfused as to how to behave and decided to live on fruits and vegetables obtained from the nearby jungles. \\nAfter some time, Rishabhadev could see their miserable condition.  Jain monks are not supposed to pick any fruits \\nand vegetables from trees by themselves, but instead go to laypeople’s hous es for alms.  He therefore decided to \\ndemonstrate the way a monk was supposed to live.  He started going from house to house for alms in silence.  \\nHowever, people did not know what to offer Rishabhadev, their once beloved King.  They offered him ornaments,  \\ntheir homes, and other valuable items, but no one thought of offering food.  As a result, Rishabhadev had to continue \\nfasting day after day. \\nAfter fasting in this way for 400 days (thirteen months and nine days), Rishabhadev passed by a sugarcane farm \\nlocated near the town of Hastinäpur.  The farm belonged to his great grandson, Shreyäns, who chose to offer \\nRishabhadev sugarcane juice.  Thus, Rishabhadev finally ended his long fast on the third day of the bright half of \\nthe month of Vaisakha.  Known as Aks haya Tritiya, this day usually falls in the month of May.  In commemoration \\nof Rishabhadev’s fast, people observe a similar austerity known as Varsitapa.  As it is not possible for people to \\nfast for 400 days, they fast on alternate days, and after 400 day s they break their fast with sugarcane juice on \\nAkshaya Tritiya (Akhätrij) day. \\nRishabhadev marrying Sunandä and \\nSumangalä'),\n",

A marvelous building was constructed for \\nthis purpose and all well-known artists were invited to make their artistic contribution to the gallery.  One artist from \\nHastinäpur possessed a special power to prepare an accurate portrait of anyone by merely seeing one part of his \\nor her body.

It was so lifelike that when prince \\nMalladin came to see the gallery and looked at the portrait, he felt as if his sister were standing there and actually \\nfolded his hands as a token of respect. \\nWhen he realized that it was merely a portrait, he was puzzled as to how the artist had obtained such minute details \\nof his sister’s body.  He was told of the special power and the talent that the artist possessed.  Although he \\nrecognized the rarity of this accomplishment, the prince also foresaw the dangers of such a talent.

He had \\ntwo queens; Queen \\nRohini, who had a son \\nnamed Balräm (Padma), \\nand Queen Devaki, who \\nhad a son named Shri \\nKrishna.  Both Balräm \\nand Shri Krishna were the \\nninth Baldev and \\nVäsudev as per Jain \\ntradition.  Shri Krishna is \\nalso the incarnation of \\nLord Vishnu (God) in the \\nHindu religion. \\nDuring this time, hunting \\nwas a favored sport and \\ngambling was considered \\na respectable activity.  \\nReligious ceremonies \\nincluded animal sacrific e, \\nand a non-vegetarian diet \\nwas very popular. \\nMeanwhile, the whole area of central India had been disturbed due to the prevailing conspiracies among various \\nkingdoms.

He welcomed Gautam-swämi, who \\ninquired about Änand’s health and asked about his special knowledge.  Änand respectfu lly replied to Gautam -\\nswämi, “Reverend Guru, I have attained Avadhi -jnän.

When he became older, many families were eager to have \\ntheir daughters marry him.  It was a no rmal practice in those days for a man to have more than one wife, so his \\nparents selected 8 girls from reputed families.  Jambu was duly engaged to all of them.  It was a joyous time for all. \\nOne day, Mahävir-swami’s ganadhar, Sudharmä-swämi, came to Räjgrihi to deliver a sermon and Jambu attended \\nthe assembly.  The sermon encouraged him to develop a very high sense of detachment towards worldly objects \\nand family members and he decided to renounce his worldly life.  However, Jambu’s parents were dismayed t o \\nhear of his intentions to renounce the world at such a young age.  The parents of the eight girls who were engaged \\nto Jambu were also very worried that no one else would marry their daughters because of their engagement to \\nJambu. \\nThey all tried to convince Jambu to relinquish his plans of becoming a monk, telling him that the rigors of an ascetic \\nlife would pose a challenge for him and that he did not realize what he was sacrificing.  They advised him to live a \\ncomfortable family life, reminding him of his obligations towards them and his future wives.  Jambu patiently listened \\nto them, but he remained firm in his decision. \\nFinally, the parents made one last effort to persuade him.  \\nThinking that Jambu would change his  mind after being \\nmarried, they requested that he get married before they gave \\ntheir blessing for his renunciation.  Jambu agreed to get \\nmarried with one condition: he would become an ascetic the \\nday after his marriage.  His parents agreed to this conditio n \\nsince they thought he would fall in love with the girls once he \\nwas married and would give up the idea of renouncing the \\nworld. \\nThe wedding took place on a grand scale.

During Mahävir’s time, it was \\nruled by King Shrenik of the Shishunäg dynasty.   This dynasty ended with the death of Shrenik’s great -grandson \\nUdayi.  Magadha then passed into the hands of the Nanda dynasty.  Nine generations later, Dhanänand ascended \\nthe throne.  This was around 300 BCE, about 200 years after Lord Mahävir’s nirväna. \\nThe greedy Dhanänand was far from being a just and noble ruler.  He had heard a legend about hidden treasure \\nthat belonged to one of his predecessors and was desperate to get his hands on it.  Unfortunately, he had no idea \\nwhere this treasure was hidden.  However, he knew that the old Prime Minister Shaktäl, who had served his father, \\nhad knowledge of the treasure’s whereabouts.  Dhanänand therefore tried everything he could to get the information \\nfrom the prime minister and locate the treasure, but Shaktä l refused to provide any information about the \\nwhereabouts of this treasure.  The King therefore forced him to retire and the administration was entrusted to other \\nministers. \\nShaktäl was a wise, highly respected person in the \\nkingdom.  Many scholars and high ranking officials admired \\nhim and were eager to consult him on important matters.  \\nHowever, they avoided communicating with him because \\nthey feared that the King would not approve. \\nShaktäl had seven daughters and two sons, Sthulibhadra \\nand Shriyäk.  Sthulibhadra was smart, brilliant, and \\nhandsome, but unambitious.  From a very young age, \\nSthulibhadra had watched the performance of a beautiful \\ndancer named Koshä in Pätliputra, the capital city of \\nMagadha.  Eventually, they fell in love .  Though his family \\ndisapproved, Sthulibhadra was deeply in love and left home \\nat the young age of 18 to live with Koshä.  He was infatuated \\nwith her and abandoned all interest in his career and other \\nfamily members.  King Dhanänand had intended to appoint \\nhim to a high position in the court, but Sthulibhadra declined \\nthe offer.  The King therefore appointed his younger \\nbrother, Shriyäk, to the position. \\nAs time passed, things began to look grim for Dhanänand’s \\nreign.  The citizens of Magadha witnessed major political \\nupheavals and turmoil.  People felt dissatisfie d with the \\ncurrent regime and looked for the end of the Nanda \\ndynasty.  King Dhanänand felt insecure and was suspicious \\nof all his ministers and advisors, including Shriyäk and his \\nfather Shaktäl. \\nAware that the King was very suspicious of him, Shaktäl bec ame worried about the political future of his younger \\nson.  Shaktäl therefore decided to sacrifice his life in order to provide proof of Shriyäk’s loyalty to the King.  He \\nrequested his son, Shriyäk, to kill him in the presence of the King and other minist ers.  This way, the King would \\nhave proof that Shriyäk was a very loyal minister.  Prior to the execution, he explained to Shriyäk that he would \\nswallow some poison so that Shriyäk would not truly (morally and religiously) be responsible for his father’s d eath.  \\nMeanwhile, the King would feel that Shriyäk was very loyal to him because he had seemingly killed his own father \\nfor the King.  Thus, Shaktäl died seemingly at the hands of his own son in order to prove his son’s loyalty.  \\nWhen Sthulibhadra learned about that tragic event, he was taken aback.  By that time, he had spent twelve years \\nwith Koshä and had never cared for anyone else.  His father’s death opened his eyes, and he started reflecting on \\nhis past.  “Twelve long years of my youth!

The lustful life he had led had taken a toll on his body, but the brightness inherited from his \\nillustrious father still glowed on his face.  Seeing Sthulibhadra’s determined and humble state, the learned Ächärya \\nsaw in him a great future for the religious order and accepted him as his pupil. \\nSthulibhadra quickly adjusted to the new pattern of his life.  The ambition that he had lacked in his youth soon \\nemerged in his adulthood.  Keen to make up for lost years, he devoted all of his ener gy to spiritual upliftment.  He \\nworked diligently, and in no time gained the confidence of his guru.  He had successfully overcome his senses of \\nattachment and lustfulness and gained control over his inner enemies.  It was time for his faith to be tested.  \\nThe monsoon season was \\napproaching and the monks \\nhad to settle in one place \\nduring the rainy season \\nwhich generally lasted four \\nmonths in the Indian climate.  \\nSthulibhadra and three other \\nsädhus who had attained a \\nhigh level of equanimity \\nwanted to test their faith and \\ndetermination by spending \\nthis time under the most \\nadverse condit ions.

The Ächärya knew that they were capable of withstanding these hardships and \\npermitted them to do this.  However, Sthulibhadra humbly asked to spend the monsoon in the picture gallery of the \\nresidence of Koshä.  The Ächärya knew how  difficult this test would be for Sthulibhadra, but he also knew \\nSthulibhadra’s determination and felt that spiritually, the monk would not progress any further without passing this \\ntest.  Therefore, he permitted Sthulibhadra to spend the monsoon at Koshä’s house. \\nSthulibhadra approached Koshä and asked her for permission to stay in the picture gallery during the monsoon \\nseason.

By this time, she was missing him and was happy to see him again, not knowing \\nthe true purpose of his return.  Fo r that monsoon season, both had different goals.  Koshä endeavored to win him \\nback into her life, using all  her seductive skills.  She  felt that having him live in her picture gallery was to her \\nadvantage.  In contrast, Sthulibhadra’s goal was to overcome the strong temptation of Koshä’s beauty.  Who would \\nwin?  Sthulibhadra’s strong faith and determination served him well during this test.  He focused his mind on spiritual \\nmeditation, contemplating the transitory nature of life and the need to break away from the cycle of birth and death.  \\nUltimately, Koshä realized the wastefulness of her life and became his disciple .

The first three monks described \\ntheir success and they were congratulated.  But when Sthulibhadra reported the success of his te st, the Ächärya \\nactually rose from his seat in all praise and hailed Sthulibhadra for performing a formidable task.  The other monks \\nbecame jealous.  Why was Sthulibhadra’s feat so much more impressive than theirs?  After all, they had endured \\nphysical hardships while he had spent the monsoon in comfort and security.  The Ächärya explained that it was an \\nimpossible feat for anyone else.  The first monk then boasted that he could easily accomplish the same task the \\nfollowing monsoon.  The Ächärya tried to dissuade him from his intent, knowing that it was beyond his capability.  \\nThe monk, wanting to prove his spiritual strength to the Ächärya, persisted and was reluctantly given permission \\nfor the next monsoon season. \\nThe next monsoon, the monk went to Koshä’s place.  The immodest pictures in the gallery were enough to excite \\nhim.  When he saw the glamorous Koshä, his remaining resistance melted away and he begged for her love.  After \\nseeing the pious life of Sthulibhadra, Koshä had learned the value of an ascetic life.  In order to teach the monk a \\nlesson, she agreed to love him \\nonly if he gave her a diamond-\\nstudded garment from Nep al, \\na t own 250 miles north of \\nPätliputra.  The monk was so \\ninfatuated that he left \\nimmediately for Nepal, \\nforgetting that monks were not \\nsupposed to travel during the \\nmonsoon.  With considerable \\ndifficulty, he procur ed the \\ngarment and returned to \\nPätliputra, conf ident of \\nreceiving Koshä’s love.  \\nKoshä accepted the beautiful \\ngarment, wiped her feet on it \\nand threw it away in the trash. \\nThe monk was stunned.  He \\nasked, “Are you crazy, \\nKoshä?  Why are you throwing away the precious gift that I have brought you with s o much difficulty?” Koshä \\nreplied, “Why are you throwing away the precious life of monkhood that you have acquired with so much effort?” \\nThe humbled monk realized his foolishness and returned to his Ächärya to report his miserable failure.  From that \\nday onwards, there was immense respect for Sthulibhadra throughout the community.  \\nSthulibhadra played a major role in later years preserving the oldest Jain scriptures, known as the twel ve Anga \\nÄgams and the fourteen p urvas.  Jain history indicates that Ächärya Bhadrabähu, the successor of Ächärya \\nSambhutivijay as the head of the religious order, was the last monk to have complete knowledge of all the Jain \\nscriptures.  Both Ächärya Sambhutivijay and Ächärya Bhadrabähu had been the disciples of Ächärya Yashobhadra. \\nIn those days, the Jain scriptures were memorized and passed down orally from guru to disciple.  They were not \\ndocumented in any form.  Under the leadership of Ächärya Bhadrabähu, Sthulibhadra thoroughly studied eleven of \\nthe twelve Anga Ägams.  However , an extended famine prevented Sthulibhadra from studying the twelfth Anga \\nÄgam, known as Drashtiväd, which contained the 14 purvas.  During the famine, Ächärya Bhadrabähu-swämi \\nmigrated south with 12, 000 disciples.  Ächärya Sthulibhadra succeeded him as the leader of the monks who stayed \\nbehind in Pätliputra.  The hardships of the famine made it difficult for the monks to observe their code of conduct \\nproperly.  In addition, many of the monks’ memories failed them and many parts of the Anga Ägams were forgotten. \\nThe famine lasted for twelve years.  After the famine, Sthulibhadra decided to recompile the Jain scriptur es.  A \\nconvention was held in Pätliputra under the leadership of Ächärya Sthulibhadra.  Eleven of the twelve Anga Ägams \\nwere orally recompiled at the convention, but none of the monks at the convention could remember the twelfth Anga \\nÄgam and its 14 purvas.  Only Ächärya Bhadrabähu swämi had this knowledge; he had left southern India and was \\nnow in the mountains of Nepal to practice a special pe nance and meditation.  The Jain sangh therefore requested \\nSthulibhadra and some other learned monks to go to Ächärya Bhadrabähu-swämi and learn the twelfth Ägam.  \\nThe monk was unable to stay detached seeing Koshä’s beauty and \\nforgot his vows in the hope of receiving Koshä’s love'),\n",

During that time, it was common for scholars to travel and engage \\nothers in debate to increase their wealth of knowledge.  Therefore, Haribhadra traveled and debated many brilliant \\nscholars.  Other scholars were un able to win discussions with him.  His talent allowed him to dominate all \\nconversations.  It was not long before he earned a formidable reputation, and scholars began avoiding entering into \\na discussion with him. \\nWhen no one came forward to counter him, he  concluded that he had no rival in the entire country.  Confident in \\nhis ability to comprehend any subject being discussed, he issued a public challenge that if anyone could present a \\ntopic that he could not understand, he would readily become his/her pupi l. \\nOne day, as he was walking through the village, he came across a royal elephant so angry that it was completely \\nout of control.  His keeper was trying his best to bring him under control, but the elephant was not responding to his \\nefforts.  The elephant  was running directly towards Haribhadra.  In grave danger of being trampled, Haribhadra \\nfrantically looked around for a safe place and saw a Jain temple.  He entered just in time to avoid being crushed by \\nthe charging elephant.  Once inside, he paused to regain his breath and then looked around the temple with \\ndisrespect.  Haribhadra had no regard for Jainism.  Because of his prejudice, he remained ignorant of Jain \\nphilosophy.  Brahmins were usually staunch Shaiväites (followers of Lord Shiva in Hinduism) and looked down upon \\nthose going to Jain temples. \\nAs he looked around, he saw the white marble idol of Lord Mahävir facing him.  Instead of seeing the graceful \\ncompassion flowing from the eyes of the Tirthankar’s idol, Haribhadra only noticed that the stomach of the idol did \\nnot epitomize the slim body of an austere saint.  He surmised that Jain Tirthankars must have enjoyed sweet foods.  \\nHe therefore made the following remark: \\n“Vapurevatavächashte Spashtam Mishtänn-Bhojitämit” \\n“Your stomach clearly indicates that you must enjoy eating sweet foods” \\nWhen the elephant left the area, Haribhadra stepped outside the temple.  On his way back, he passed the Upäshray \\nof Jain nuns (Sädhvis).  He heard the following verse that was recited by a Sädhvi named Yäkini Mahattarä:  \\nChakkidugam Haripanagam Panagam Chakki Ya Kesavo Chakki \\nKesav Chakki Kesav Du Chakki Kesi Ya Chakki Ya  \\nHaribhadra-Suri listening to Yäkini Mahattarä’s explaining Jain philosophy'),\n",

Despite his arrogance, Haribhadra was also a man of his word, and without further \\nhesitation, he presented himself to the Jain nun Mahattarä.  He explained his pledge and requested that she accept \\nhim as a pupil.  Mahattarä explained that Jain nuns could not have males as pupils.

He explained to them that his knowledge would remain incomplete without gaining \\nknowledge of Jainism in detail.

One should not let pride come in the way of \\nacquiring knowledge.  Jain Ägams describe the essen ce of Jainism in a logical and \\nconvincing manner.

Then, \\nthey could defeat the Buddhist monks in debate.  Initially, Haribhadra-suri did not approve, but Hans and Paramhans \\npersisted and ultimately secured his permission.

He challenged them to a debate in the royal court, with the stipulation that whoever \\nlost would be put to death.  Haribhadra -suri’s violent reaction to his nephews’ deaths saddened  Guru Jinabhatta-\\nsuri and Sädhvi Mahattarä.  Haribhadra-suri won the debate.  Luckily, sädhvi Mahattarä convinced him to abandon \\nthe idea of killing his opponent.  Haribhadra-suri realized from this episode that his undue attachment for Hans and \\nParamhans had led him to indulge in a violent attitude.

The Ächärya predicted that Pähini would give birth to a son who would make great progress in the areas \\nof spiritual knowledge, conduct, \\nand logic.  When her son was \\nborn, she named him Chängdev. \\nThe next time Ächärya Devasuri \\nwas in Dhandhu kä, he saw \\nPähini carrying her son.  He said \\nto Pähini, “Let me take care of \\nthis brilliant son.  He has the \\npotential of being a great spiritual \\nleader.” Pähini initially refused to \\nrelinquish her son to him, but the \\nÄchärya persisted and reminded \\nher that her son would become a \\nfamous monk and would glorify \\nthe Jain order.  He requested \\nthat she sacrifice self -interest \\nand love for the child for the good \\nof the people at large.  Finally, \\nPähini surrendered and gave her \\nson to the Ächärya.  He initiated \\nChängdev into Jain monkhood \\nand renamed him Somchandra. \\nSomchandra was very intelligent \\nand quickly mastered various \\nphilosophies, logic, scriptures, \\nnyäya, grammar, and more.  \\nSimultaneously, he cultivated \\nexcellent virtues like \\nforbearance, tolerance, holiness, \\nsimplicity, discipline, chastity, \\nand generosity.  Somchandra \\nwas incomparable in \\nadministration and efficiency, \\nand Ächärya Devasuri made Somchandra an Ächärya when he was only twenty-one years old, changing his name \\nto Ächärya Hemchandra. \\nThe fame of Hemchandra’s knowledge gradually spread everywhere.  Due to the efforts of Hemchandra and the \\ncooperation of King Siddharäj of Gujarat, a higher and nobler form of culture was established in the region.  When \\nKing Siddharäj died, Kumärpäl succeeded him.  King Kumärpäl and Ächärya Hemchandra were to enjoy a lifelong \\nrelationship of disciple and teacher.  The seeds of this spiritual relation had already been sown earlier; Ächärya \\nHemchandra had predicted seven years back that Kumärpäl would become King.  Additionally, he had once saved \\nthe future King’s life.  Kumärpäl therefore considered Hemchandra his spiritual teacher (guru) and benefactor and \\ngave him exceptional honor.  Kumärpäl sought Hemchandra’s advice in shaping his kingdom, and in a very short \\ntime Gujarat became a center of non-violence, learning, and good culture. \\nIn his efforts, Hemchandra did not think of the development of his own career but always of the welfare of all citizens.  \\nHowever, some Brahmins were very jealous of Ächärya Hemchandra’s influence over the King and tried to disgrace \\nVarious incidences from Ächärya Hemchandra and King \\nKumärpäl’s life'),\n",

By Sumangalä, he had 99 sons, of whom Bharat was the eldest and the best \\nknown, and one daughter named Brähmi.  By the second wife, Sunandä, he had one son named Bähubali and a \\ndaughter named Sundari.  All of them were given proper training in different arts and crafts.  Bharat became a great \\nwarrior and a politician.  Sunandä's son was tall, well built, and strong, and hence was called Bähubali.  In Sanskrit, \\n“Bähu” means arm and “Bali” means mighty.  Brähmi attained a very high level of literary proficiency.  She developed \\nthe first known script, known as the Brähmi script.  Sundari was very proficient in mathematics.  After Lord \\nRishabhadev attained omniscience, both girls renounced their worldly lives and became his disciples. \\nAs a King, Rishabhadev had the responsibility of a large kingdom.  At the time of his renunciation, he handed over \\nthe city of Vinitä, also known as Ayodhyä, to Bharat, an d the city of Taxshilä ( Pottanpur according to Digambar \\nscriptures) to Bähubali.

After developing his army and weapons, he embarked upon his \\njourney of conquest.  There was hardly anyone at that time who could withstand his well-equipped army.  He easily \\nconquered all the regions around Vinitä.  Then, he turned his attention towards the lands of his 98 brothers and \\nasked them to acknowledge his superiority.  They all turned to Lord Rishabhadev to ask for advice.  Bhagawän \\nexplained to them the importance of conquering their inner enemies (passions) and not external enemies.

However, he had a different vision and would not surrender.  He was conscious of \\nhis right to rule the kingdom handed over to him by his father.  Moreover, he had the will and capacity to fight any \\ninvader.  Therefore, wh en he received Bharat’s request to accept a subordinate status, he refused and began \\npreparations to fight. \\nBoth brothers were strong, and war between the two was sure to result in large -scale bloodshed.  Therefore, \\ncounselors on both sides tried to dissua de their masters from resorting to war, but neither of them would give up \\nhis ground.  War seemed inevitable as the brothers brought their armies face to face on the battlefield.  Everyone \\nshuddered at the prospect of the heavy casualties that would result from the imminent war. \\nThe counselors then made one last effort.  They explained to their masters that the main point of contention was to \\ndetermine which brother was superior.  Instead of assembling a large -scale war for that purpose, a fight between \\nthe two brothers would just as easily settle the issue and would avert unnecessary bloodshed.  Both brothers thought \\nthis was an excellent idea and immediately agreed.  The plan was to engage in a straight duel, and the victor of the \\nduel would be acknowledged as the leader. \\nOn the day of the duel, Bharat tried to beat Bähubali by using his various permissible weapons, but all his attempts \\nto defeat Bähubali failed.  Bharat contemplated on how unbearable and shameful his defeat would be.  His ambition \\nto rule the entire world was also at stake if he did not defeat his brother.  He grew desperate and ignored the rules \\nof the duel by unleashing his miracle wheel, the Chakraratna, at Bähubali.  However, he had forgotten one important \\ncharacteristic of the miracle weapon: it would not harm any blood relatives of the bearer.  Therefore, the wheel \\nreturned to Bharat and Bähubali remained unharmed. \\nBähubali became enraged by Bharat’s violation of the rules of the duel, and he thought of smashing his elder brother \\nwith his mighty fist.  As he raised his hand for that purpose, the onlookers trembled at the thought of Bharat’s \\nimminent death. \\nBut just as he was about to unleash his wrath, a flash of insight came to him.  “What am I doing?” thought Bähubali.  \\n“Have I gone m ad?  Am I going to kill my elder brother for the sake of some worldly possessions that my revered \\nfather willingly abandoned and which my other brothers have given up?” He shuddered at the prospect of the \\nimminent death of Bharat, seeing the evil in killing a respected brother.  At that very moment he changed his mind.  \\nInstead of lowering his hand to hit his brother, he used it to pull out his hair (as the monks do during Dikshä) as a \\nsymbol of giving up everything and renouncing the worldly life. \\nHowever, Bähubali had not lost all his pride and ego.  He realized that if he went to his father and stated his intention \\nof renouncing the world, he would be required to bow down and be subservient to his 98 younger brothers who \\nwere senior to him in monkhood.  This was unacceptable to him.  Instead, Bähubali decided to seek enlightenment \\non his own and started meditating on the very same spot upon which he stood.  He became so immersed in his \\nmeditation that he lost track of time and could not remember how long h e had stood there.  He was motionless for \\nso long that creepers began to grow around his feet. \\nA year passed with Bähubali standing in that posture of meditation, yet he did not gain enlightenment.  How could \\nhe gain it without shedding his ego?  At last, Lord Rishabhadev sent Brähmi and Sundari to bring him to the right \\npath.  They came to the place where Bähubali was meditating.  Seeing their mighty brother standing like a rock, \\nthey calmly told him, “You cannot achieve enlightenment while sitting on an e lephant.  You need to get off the \\nelephant.” As their familiar voices reached Bähubali’s ears, he opened his eyes in amazement and looked around \\nbut did not find himself on an elephant.  He then realized that the elephant they were referring to was his ego .  He \\nimmediately dissolved his ego and decided to go to Lord Rishabhadev and was ready to bow to his 98 brothers. \\nDuring his long penance, he had overcome all other defiling passions except ego which still remained between him \\nand enlightenment.  Now his ego was dissolved and humbleness prevailed in its place.  Therefore, as he took the \\nfirst step towards the Lord, he achieved full enlightenment and became omniscient.  (By Digambar tradition, \\nBähubali later became the first person to attain liberation in this era.  However, Shvetämbar tradition indicates that \\nRishabhadev’s mother, Marudevi, attained liberation first in this era.) \\nIn memory of this event, a gigantic, 57 -foot upright statue of Bähubali stands on the hill of Vindhyägiri at \\nShrävanbelgolä, near Bangalore in southern India.  It is made out of a single rock of granite and was erected about \\n1000 years ago.  Pilgrims and visitors marvel that the statue, even under the open sky, stands spotless today.'),\n",

When Shripäl was five years old, his father died.  King Singhrath’s ambitious brother, Ajitsen, took \\nthis opportunity to seize the throne.  In order to make his position as King secure, he was keen to get rid of Shripäl.  \\nWhen Kamal-prabhä became aware of Ajitsen’s vicious plan, she  fled from Champänagar with  her son.  Learning \\nabout her escape, Ajitsen sent his trusted soldiers to pursue her. \\nAs the soldiers got close, she did not know how to save her son.  She saw a group of lepers, and in desperation, \\nshe asked them to take her son into their custody.  They warned her about the risk of her son contracting the \\ndisease of leprosy from them.  However, she had no choice if she wanted to save her son, so she entrusted her \\nson to them. \\nShripäl grew up to be very bold and handsome.  The people of the leper colony be came very fond of him and took \\ngreat care of Shripäl.  Ultimately, Shripäl contracted leprosy.  When he became a youth, the people made him their \\nleader, and named him Umar Ränä.  Under his leadership the group traveled from place to place and one day \\narrived at the city of Ujjayini, the capital of the Mälwä region. \\nKing Prajäpäl was ruling there.  He and Queen Rupsundari had two intelligent and beautiful daughters, Sursundari \\nand Mayanä-sundari.  The King loved both of them and made adequate arrangements for their training in the arts \\nand crafts, which the girls mastered in due course.  One day, the King decided to test their knowledge and called \\nthem in the assembly hall.  He asked a number of questions t o Sursundari who gave satisfactory replies to all of \\nthem.  At the end, the King asked her by whose favor she got all her skills and also the amenities and luxuries that \\nshe enjoyed.  The girl humbly replied that she gained all that by the King’s favor.  Pleased with her replies, the King \\ndecided to reward her appropriately. \\nThen, he asked several questions to Mayanä-sundari.  She too gave satisfactory replies to all his questions.  At the \\nend, the King asked her the same question that he had asked Sursunda ri.  He had expected Mayanä to give an \\nidentical reply and thus please him.  However, Mayanä had total faith in the religious philosophy she had studied at \\nlength.  She firmly believed that everything that she had received had been the result of her karma.  She must have \\nearned good karma in the past that resulted in the happy situations that she was undergoing.  If she did not have \\nthat karma to her credit, no one could bestow happiness on her.  She therefore replied:  “O father! The great King! \\nWith due respect to you, all the comfort that you provide me are only because of my meritorious (Punya) karma.  \\nEveryone gets whatever is written in his or her destiny due to his or her karma.  You yourself cannot give or take \\naway anything.” \\nEverything that she had received had been the result of her Karma.  She must have earned good Karma in the \\npast that resulted in the happy situations that she was undergoing.  If she did not have that Karma to her credit, \\nno one could bestow happiness on her. The King was exasperated to hear the unexpected reply.  He repeatedly \\nasked her to consider how she could have obtained anything without his generosity.  Mayanä replied that \\neverything, right from her being born as his daughter up to her present situation, could occur solely as a \\nconsequence of her good or bad karmas, and no one could have made any difference.  \\nThe King grew angry with her unexpected persistence.  He could not believe that the girl could have received \\nanything without his favor, and did not agree that everything happens according to one’s own karma.  He therefore \\ndecided to teach her a lesson, and asked his men to find the ugliest man in Ujjayini.  The men spotted Umar Ränä \\nand brought him to the court.  In utter disdain, the King instantly got Mayanä married to Umar.  He gave them some \\nbasic things and a small house and asked Mayanä to undergo the result of her karma.  Rupsundari was very \\nunhappy at the sudden turn of events in her daughter’s life, but she could not speak against her husband’s will.  On \\nthe other hand, the King looked for a suitable match for Sursundari in appreciation of her replies and had her married \\nto prince Aridaman of Shankhapuri. \\nMayanä was deeply religious.

Äyambil is \\nobserved by having only one meal a day of very plain food \\nwithout any spices, milk, sugar, salt, oil, butter, fruits, or \\nvegetables (sometimes minor exceptions are made by \\ngurus for certain spices).

This \\npenance and meditation is to be observed for nine days, \\ntwice a year, during the month of March/April (Chaitra) and \\nSeptember/October (Ashwin).  The couple was to do this \\npenance for four and half years, resulting in Nine Äyambil \\nOlis (one every six months). \\nAccordingly, Mayanä and Shripäl devoutly observed the \\nNavapad worship and penance with all  its vitality.  The \\nresult was miraculous.  Shripäl’s skin disease started \\nfading, and in due course, he was totally cured of leprosy \\nand regained the skin that he had before contracting the \\ndisease.  Now he looked like the handsome prince that he \\nhad been.  Mayanä was very happy with this result and \\nthanked her karma for that change too.

Eventually, as the son of Ilächi, he came to be known as Ilächiputra and then Ilächikumär.  He was \\nraised with care and attention and never lacked any luxuries, growing up to be a handsome youth.  Soon, his parents \\nfelt it was time to find a wife for him.  Luckily, th ey did not need to look very far as they were a prosperous family \\nand Ilächikumär was their only son.  Many families wanted their daughters to marry him.  His parents prepared a \\nlist of selected names and asked Ilächikumär to choose the one that he liked the most.  However, Ilächikumär could \\nnot make a selection. \\nOne day, a party of acrobats came to Ilävardhan.  In those days there were no stadiums where acrobats could \\nperform, so they performed their routines for their audience on the open streets.  Beatin g drums to announce their \\narrival, the acrobats planted poles in an open square off the main street and connected them with ropes while a \\nlarge crowd gathered.  They then began their routine, climbing the poles one after another and demonstrating their \\nskills, walking and jumping over the high rope with ease above the fascinated audience.  Attracted by the \\ncommotion, Ilächikumär also went to watch the show.  While enjoying the performance, his attention was drawn to \\nthe chief acrobat’s beautiful young daugh ter who was dancing gracefully to the drums with bells on her feet.  \\nIlächikumär was so mesmerized by her beauty and charm that he could not take his eyes off her.  \\nAt the end of the show, the acrobats descended the rope and started collecting money from th e audience.  People \\nwere very pleased with the performance and paid handsomely.  After collecting a large amount of money, the \\nacrobats left the square to camp for the night and everyone else went home.  Though Ilächikumär also returned \\nhome, his mind was still on the beautiful girl he had seen that day.  At dinner, his parents found him silent and \\nunresponsive; they had never seen him so dazed.  His father questioned his absent -mindedness, but he did not \\nanswer.  When his mother persistently asked for the reason for his silence, he finally replied that his heart was \\nattracted to the acrobat girl and he wanted to marry her. \\nHis mother was taken aback to hear that.  She said that she could find him a very beautiful and lovable girl from a \\nhigh caste and respectable family and asked him to forget the lower caste acrobat girl, but Ilächikumär replied that \\nhe had never met any other girl who attracted him and he wanted to marry her.  Acknowledging his resolve on the \\nmatter, she told her husband about their son’s intentions. \\nDhandatta was shocked to hear this.  He tried to dissuade his son from his intentions but Ilächikumär remained \\nfirm.  Since Dhandatta was a sensible man, he could see that Ilächikumär would not be at peace without that girl.  \\nHe did not want to  lose his son for the sake of prestige.  Therefore, he called the chief of acrobats and requested \\nhim to give his daughter in marriage to Ilächikumär. \\nHowever, the acrobat refused, saying that he was bound by a condition of his tribe.  Dhandatta thought th at he \\nmight be looking for money for the girl and offered to give as much wealth as the acrobat wanted in return for \\nagreeing to marry his daughter to Ilächikumär.  The acrobat  however declined the offer and again replied that he \\ncould not break the condition, so Dhandatta then asked him what this condition was.  The acrobat said that he could \\ngive his daughter only to a person who could win an award from a royal court by pleasing the King with his acrobatic \\nskill and then use the prize money to provide dinner to his community. \\nDhandatta was disappointed to hear a condition that was apparently impossible for his son to fulfill.  After he \\nexplained to his wife what had happened, she told her son and said that the girl would only marry an expert acrobat \\nand asked him to forget her. \\nIlächikumär was silent but his mind was racing with thoughts.  He felt that he would not be able to live happily \\nwithout the girl and was willing to make any sacrifice for her.  He decided that he was even prepared to learn \\nacrobatic skills for that purpose.  His parents misunderstood his silence as disappointment and thought that in time \\nhe would recover.  For a time, they tried to divert his attention to other matters to help him forget and Ilächikumär \\nallowed them to believe that t hey were succeeding, but his mind was made up.

He realized the role of karma \\nin the life of every being and thereby learned to maintain a high level of equa nimity.  In almost all aspects, he \\nrigorously observed the code of conduct for monks.  However, he could not overcome one problem.  It was difficult \\nfor him to stay hungry and so he could not fast.  He needed to eat at least once a day.  Even during Paryus han \\nParva, Kurgadu could not fast for a single day.  As he ate his food on the days of Paryushan, he felt miserable and \\nregretted that he was not able to fast.  He attributed his inability to fast to his previous karmas.  When the other \\nmonks observed their fasts, he praised them and rendered every type of service to them.  He wished in his heart \\nthat he could someday observe fasts. \\nIt was during one monsoon season that an event occurred that changed his situation.  During the monsoon season, \\nJain monks forgo traveling and remain in one place for the duration of the monsoons.  Paryushan Parva falls during \\nthis time.  During that year’s Paryushan Parva, Ächärya Dharmaghosh-suri, along with many of his disciples \\nincluding Muni Kurgadu, remained in the town.  M any of the monks undertook long fasts, some extending more \\nthan a month.  Kurgadu felt disappointed that he could not observe such austerities.  Especially on the day of \\nSamvatsari, he wished that he could observe a day-long fast. \\nHe began the day in an earnest effort to avoid eating.  However, before noon, he felt very hungry and could not do \\nwithout food.  He was surprised at the kind of karma he had acquired where he could not fast even for a day, but \\nhe reluctantly approached the guru and begged for his permission to go for alms.  The guru lovingly tried to persuade \\nhim to go without food for just one day, feeling that he should be inspired to observe a fast at least for that day, \\nespecially when all the other monks were on long fasts.  Kurgadu humbly replied that he did wish to observe a fast \\nand very much regretted his inability to fast.  Due to his humility, the guru took pity on his fate and compassionately \\nallowed him to go for alms. \\nKurgadu went for alms and accepted the food that was offered to him.  Returning, he presented the alms to his guru \\nas part of the monk’s code of conduct and modestly begged his permission to eat.  Although the guru gave his \\npermission willingly, the other monks made negative remarks.  They unsympathetically said that he did not deserve \\nto be a monk for eating on an auspicious day.  Kurgadu listened to the remarks quietly.  He went to a corner and \\nreluctantly started to eat. \\nWhile eating, Kurgadu dwelt deeply on the inability of his body to remain without food for a day.   Learned as he \\nwas, he could see that it must be the result of his previous karma.  He understood that all karmas are shed after \\nextending the appropriate consequence and this karma too would be shed.  He made up his mind to passively \\naccept what had been ordained by his karma.  Because of his study of the scriptures, he had gained insight about \\nthe true nature of his soul.  Earlier, despising himself for not observing a fast had prevented him from full realization \\nof that true nature.  Now  his willingness to accept what was a physical limitation endowed him with the insight of \\ndistinguishing the nature of the soul from the varying states of the body and mind.  His new-found insight gave rise \\nto the manifestation of the true nature of the soul, and his real ization was strong enough to destroy all the defiling \\nkarmas on the spot and he gained omniscience (keval-jnän) immediately while he was eating. \\nWhen one attains omniscience, the heavenly beings arrive to offer their obeisance.  When other monks saw the \\nheavenly beings coming towards them, they thought that the heavenly beings were coming to praise them for their \\nsevere austerities.  Instead, the heavenly beings turned to Kurgadu and offered their obeisance to him.  No one \\ncould understand why those observi ng severe austerity were left out while the one who could not observe it at all \\nhad gained full enlightenment. \\nIn amazement, the monks went to Dharmaghosh -suri and asked him the reason for what had happened.  The \\nÄchärya said that they were all feeling ver y proud of their austerities and were unnecessarily disapproving of \\nKurgadu for not observing a fast.  Therefore, they were smeared by perception obscuring karma.  He urged them \\nto bear in mind that the primary purpose of observing austerities or any other religious practice was to gain modesty \\nthat leads to right perception, which in turn helps to attain equanimity. \\nThe monks had misjudged Kurgadu, who had realized the essence of religion.  Earlier, he had acquired obstructing \\nkarma that did not allow him to observe the austerity.  He sincerely repented for that karma which had become \\noperative in his current life, and by properly comprehending the role of karma, he acquired right perception.  By \\nbearing the consequence of those karmas with equanimity, he w as able to wipe them out without acquiring new \\nones.  Thereupon, the monks realized that they were indulging in unnecessary vanity that obstructed right \\nperception.'),\n",

King Shrenik knew that it w as an auspicious dream.  He called the dream experts who predicted that \\nthe queen would give birth to a very handsome and intelligent son who will excel in everything.  The King and queen \\nwere very pleased to hear this. \\nDuring the third month of her pregnancy, queen Dhärini \\nhad an irresistible urge to ride an elephant in the country \\nwith the King with the sky decorated with clouds of colorful \\nhues, lightning flashing, and rain pouring.  In most parts of \\nIndia, it only rai ns during the monsoon season, which is \\nusually from June to October.  Queen Dhärini, however, \\nhad the urge during the off -season.  The fulfillment of her \\nurge was therefore a problem.  In order to see that her \\nhealth and well-being were not affected by the unsatisfied \\nurge, the King asked his eldest son, Abhaykumär, who was \\nalso the Prime Minister of the state, for a solution to satisfy \\nthe queen’s urge.  Abhaykumär had a friend who could do \\nmiracles.  The friend arranged events according to \\nDhärini’s urge.   She was therefore able to ride on an \\nelephant with the King and satisfy her urge. \\nIn due course, Queen Dhärini gave birth to a very \\nhandsome and adorable baby boy.  Rain in the  Indian \\nlanguage is called Megh, so in commemoration of her urge \\nduring pregnancy, the boy was named Meghakumär.  At \\nthe age of 8, he was sent to school, where he learned all \\n72 types of arts and crafts and became an accomplished \\nyouth.  He got married and enjoyed all the pleasures of \\nworldly life. \\nOnce, Lord Mahävir came to Räjgrih i, the capital city of \\nMagadha, and stayed in the Gunashil monastery.  Almost \\nevery resident of Räjgrihi went to listen to his sermons.  \\nMeghakumär went as well.  The sermon made a lasting impression on him.  He realized the transitory nature of \\nworldly situations and decided to renounce his worldly life.  His parents were sad to hear about his plan.  They tried \\neverything possible to prevent him from renouncing his worldly life.  However, he remained firm.  Nevertheless, in \\norder to satisfy his parents’ wi shes, he agreed to become the King for one day.  He was ceremoniously crowned \\nKing with all the royal pomp.  Immediately after that, he left everything, renounced worldly life, and became a disciple \\nmonk of Lord Mahävir. \\nAt night, as a junior monk, he was given a place to sleep near the entrance.  During the night, other monks using \\nthe restrooms had to walk past his side.  Since no lamps are allowed in the upäshray (the monks’ residence), they \\nhappened to trample on his bed and sometimes their feet acciden tally touched his body in the dark.  Poor \\nMeghakumär could not sleep for the whole night.  He had grown up in luxuries.  Therefore, it was difficult for him to \\nbear the accidental kicking by the monks and his bed and body being smeared in dirt.  He felt that he could not bear \\nthat sort of a miserable life and decided to give up the life of a monk. \\nIn the morning, he went to Lord Mahävir to seek permission to return home.  Mahävir was aware of the discomforts \\nthat Meghakumär had faced the previous night and told him, “Meghakumär, you do not remember, but let me \\ndescribe to you the discomforts that you faced during your previous life.” \\n“In your previous life you were Meruprabhä, the King of elephants.

While playing, he saw a monk.  The monk’s name was Gautam \\nswämi, the chief disciple of Lord Mahävir.  He was barefoot and bald.  He was going from one house to another to \\nget alms (food).  Aimuttä ran to him and invited him to his palace to get food, saying this would make his moth er \\nand him very happy.  Gautam swämi agreed, and they went to the palace.  Aimuttä’s mother, Queen Shrimati, was \\nstanding on the balcony overlooking the garden.  She saw Gautam swämi and Aimuttä coming towards the palace.  \\nShe was very happy and came down to receive Gautam swämi.  She welcomed him with devotion and said, \\n“Matthaena Vandämi (my salutation to you).” She asked Aimuttä to go and get hi s favorite food to offer Gautam \\nswämi.  Aimuttä brought lädoos (sweets) and started putting them in the container even though Gautam swämi said \\nhe didn’t need that many.  Aimuttä was very happy to be offering food to the monk.  \\nAs Gautam swämi started to leave, Aimuttä said, “Your bag is heavy.  Please let me carry it for you.”  \\nGautam swämi said, “Aimuttä, I cannot give it to you because it can only be carried by those who have taken dikshä \\nand have become a monk.” \\nAimuttä asked, “What is dikshä?” \\nGautam swämi explained to him that when someone takes a vow of dikshä, he renounces his worldly life, his house, \\nhis family, and all other social and economic ties.  Then he becomes a monk.  People take Dikshä to avoid the \\naccumulation of bad karma and to attain liberation.  In normal everyday living, people are involved in various \\nactivities, which cause them to accumulate karmas.  On the other hand, monks and nuns avoid all the activities of \\nhouseholders in order to avoid accumulating these karmas. \\nAimuttä became curious and asked, “Gurudev, you do not commit sins! However, don’t you need to eat?  Don’t you \\nneed a place to live?  All these activities cause sins which acquire bad karmas.” \\nGautam swämi was pleased with the child’s interest to learn more.  So he explained, “We take food but we do not \\naccept food which is made especially for us.  We stay in a place but we do not  own it, and we do not stay there for \\nmore than a few days at a time.  We do not keep money, and we do not take part in any business or any organization.  \\nThus, as a monk, we do not do any activity that causes sins. \\nAimuttä said, “In that case, Gurudev, I want to take dikshä.” \\nAimuttä and Gautam swämi walked to the place where Lord Mahävir was giving a sermon.  Aimuttä joined the \\nothers to listen to his teachings.  In that sermon, Aimuttä learned what life is all about and what one can do if he or \\nshe wants to eliminate worldly suffering.  Aimuttä expressed his desire to become a monk to Lord Mahävir.  Lord \\nMahävir said, “We cannot let you take dikshä without your parents’ permission.” Aimuttä replied, “That is easy.  I \\nwill go home, get their permission, and come back.” \\nAimuttä went home.  He told his mother, “Mother, I want to take dikshä.  Remember you used to say that our \\nhousehold life is full of violence and causes sins?  Gautam swämi and Lord Mahävir also said the same.  I want to \\nbe free of sins.  Therefore, please give me permission to take dikshä.” \\nAimuttä’s mother was surprised by his words.  She was happy in her mind for his fear of sins and his desire to take \\ndikshä because she was a religious woman.  However, she wanted to be sure that Aimuttä understood what “taking \\ndikshä” meant.  So she said, “My son, to take dikshä is a very hard and disciplined life.  You will not have a mother \\nor a father to take care of you.  How will you be able to handle such suffering?”  \\nAimuttä said, “Mother, this household life also has a lot of suffering.  At least we know that as a monk the suffering \\nwill help destroy karmas and lead to liberation.” \\nHis mother was very happy to hear this.  However, she wanted to test Aimuttä’s determination further.  She said, \\n“Son, why are you in such a hurry?  Wait for a while.

After listening to the sermon, Änand decided to \\nfollow Jainism by accepting the twelve vows of a householder.  Änand observed these vows for fourteen years and \\nprogressed spiritually.  One day Änand s hrävak attained a special ability known as Avadhi -jnän (clairvoyance) by \\nperforming severe penance, austerities, and meditation.  His Avadhi -jnän was purer and more powerful than that \\nacquired by other laypeople in their spiritual progress. \\nAt this time , Lord Mahävir and his disciples were in town.

You need to do Präyashchitta (atonement) for imagining these visions.” Änand was puzzled.  He knew \\nthat he was correct but his guru questioned his truthfulness and told him to repent for it.  He therefore politely asked \\nGautam swämi, “Does one need to repent for speaking the truth?” Gautam swämi, equally puzzled, replied, “No \\none has to repent for speaking the truth.” He then left Änand thinking that he would reconfirm this w ith Bhagawän \\nMahävir. \\nGautam swämi returned to Bhagawän Mahävir and asked about Änand’s special ability.

Instead of feeling regret for the violence, the King felt proud and highly \\nelated at his powers.  The  feeling of too much arrog ance for the gross violence caused him to acq uire the karma \\nleading to an infernal life. \\nThe King remembered the incident.

Once it is acquired, it cannot be changed.  Karma that is indelible cannot be \\nchanged no matter how hard one tries. \\nBhagawän Mahävir suggested the following four alternatives to him: \\n1. There was a highly religious householder, known as Puniä Shrävak, in Räjgrihi.  He had given up all his \\ndesires and was leading a purely spiritual life.  For his livelihood he depended upon the innocent \\noccupation of making slivers out of cotton.  The Indian word for sliver is Puni.  He was therefo re known \\nas Puniä Shrävak.  He earned very little out of that but felt contented with whatever he could get.  He \\nused to spend most of his  time in sämäyik.  Bhagawän Mahävir suggested the King obtain the merit of \\none sämäyik from Puniä Shrävak.  The King thought that it was very simple.  He appr oached the man \\nand requested the merit of only one sämäyik.  Puniä said that he had no objection, but how could he do \\nthat since the merits as well as demerits happen to be non-transferable?  The King was disappointed. \\n2. The King had a maid servant named Kapilä .  She never gave alms to anyone.  Bhagawän Mahävir \\nsuggested to the King that he make her give alms on at least one day.  Accordingly, the King asked her \\nto do so.  She however replied that she would not even tak e anything in her hand for giving alms.  The \\nKing therefore arranged to tie a scoop to her hand and asked her to give alms.  While doing so, the maid \\nservant murmured that the King’s scoop is giving the alms, not me.  That plan also thus failed. \\n3. The King had a butcher named Kalsaurik who loved slaughtering animals.  Bhagawän Mahävir suggested \\nthe King to make sure that butcher Kalsaurik did not slaughter any animals for one day.  This seemed \\nvery easy to the King.  He ordered Kalsaurik to avoid killing the next day.  The butcher replied that he \\nwas so conditioned to kill that he could not even spend even one day without killing.  The King therefore \\nordered his men to hang him inverted in a well so that he could not undertake any actions of slaughtering.  \\nHowever, Kalsaurik was so conditioned that he imagined and drew the animals in the water of the well \\nand slaughtered them.  Thus the King could not stop him and that effort failed. \\n4. Bhagawän Mahävir then asked the King to observe the restraint of one Navkä rshi in which one is not \\nsupposed to eat or drink anything until 48 minutes after sunrise.

He lived in a remote cave in  the Vaibhärgiri \\nhill near the city of Räjgrihi.  He was very clever in his profession and never left any traces of his burglary.  He and \\nhis wife, Rohini, had a son named Rohineya.  As Rohineya grew up, he learned his father’s profession and \\neventually became an expert burglar.  He even surpassed his father in intelligence and smartness.  It was almost \\nimpossible to recognize him when he was in disguise.  If someone pursued him, he could outrun them.  He robbed \\nthe rich and hid the treasures in the most unexpected and inaccessible places.  He extended help to the poor from \\nthe wealth that he accumulated.  Many of them felt grateful and were pleased with him.  Therefore, they were not \\nwilling to help government officials track him down. \\nLohkhur was now very old and could see that his life was coming to an end.  When he was on his deathbed, he \\ncalled Rohineya and said that he was very happy with the expertise that he had shown in committing burglary.  In \\norder to remain successful, he advised his son never to listen to the sermons of Lord Mahävir because his teachings \\nwere not conducive to their profession.  Rohineya promised his father he would abide by his advice.  \\nAfter Lohkhur died, Rohineya expanded his burglary so much that it became almost impossible for rich families to \\nensure the safety of their property when they went out.  They were constantly afraid that Rohineya would go to their \\nhome during their absence and take their jewelry  and other valuables.  Some people went to King Shrenik and \\nrequested him to take action to protect them from Rohineya’s burglaries since police officers had failed to do \\nanything about the matter.  The King therefore asked his most intelligent chief minister, Abhaykumär, to take charge \\nof arresting Rohineya. \\nOnce, while Rohineya was secretly on his way to Räjgrihi, he had to pass by the side of the Lord Mahävir’s assembly \\nhall.  He remembered his father’s advice of never listening to Lord Mahävir’s sermon.   He put his hands over his \\nears.  Unfortunately, at that moment he stepped on a sharp thorn that went deep into his foot.  He had to take his \\nhands off his ears in order to take out the thorn.

However, the life of a heavenly being does not lead to ultimate \\nliberation, which provides eternal bliss and happiness.  Therefore, \\nheavenly beings crave a human life.” \\nBy that time Rohineya had removed the thorn from his foot.  He then covered his ears again with his hands and \\nproceeded towards the city. \\nIn the city, Abhaykumär had secretly posted trained soldiers in disguise at the gates and at all important locations.  \\nHe himself remained watchful.  When Rohineya entered the city, a trained soldier recognized him even though he \\nwas in the disguise of a farmer.  The soldier sent a message to Abhaykumär that an unidentified person had entered \\nthe city.  Abhaykumär became very alert.  As Rohineya passed by, Abhaykumär glanced at him from a secret place.  \\nHe recognized the burglar even in disguise and instructed his men to surround him.  Since Rohi neya was very \\nsmart, he quickly recognized the danger.  He ran towards the city wall.  Unfortunately for him, there were soldiers \\nnear the wall.  He was easily apprehended and put in jail. \\nThe next day he was presented in the royal court.  As Rohineya was in disguise, it was hard to identify him as the \\nburglar.  Abhaykumär was sure, but how could the accused be punished without proof of his identity?  When the \\nKing asked him about his identity, Rohineya replied that he was a farmer named Durgä chandra who belonged to \\nthe Shäligräm village.  He had come to Räjgrihi to visit the capital and was returning home when the watchmen \\napprehended him.  Rohineya had made arrangements for that assumed identity with the residents of the village.  \\nWhen inquiries were made in that village, the people confirmed what Rohineya had stated in court.  \\nAbhaykumär had to devise a plan for getting a confession from Rohineya regarding the burglaries.  He came to \\nknow that Rohineya was fond of drinks.  He therefore arranged to serve an excessive amount of wine to the thief.  \\nThe excessive wine made him unconscious.  While unconscious, Rohineya was cleaned, dressed in extravagantly \\nperfumed royal garments, and adorned with valuable jewelry.  He was then placed on a luxurious velvet bed of  \\nsandalwood on the top floor of a palatial building.  As Rohineya regained his consciousness, he saw himself in \\nheavenly surroundings.  There was a breathtaking view all around.  The walls, ceiling, and floor were crystalline.  \\nBeautiful maidens were wavin g scented air with diamond studded fans, soft serene music was heard in the \\nbackground, fairylike dancers were dancing in tune with the music, and divine musicians were getting ready for a \\nmusical concert. \\nRohineya could not make out where he was.  He asked one of the girls where he was and why they were all serving \\nhim so well.  The girl replied that he was their new King in heaven.  He had attained all the divine comforts, which \\nnow belonged to him.  He could live like Indra, the King of heaven, and enjoy life with heavenly damsels. \\n“Could this be true for a burglar like me?” he asked himself.  However, he then remembered that he was helpful to \\nthe poor and needy, and he was sure that god had been just.  “Or could this be the plan of Abhaykumär?” he thought \\nagain.  It was hard for him to decide what the truth really was.  He therefore thought it was best to wait and see.  \\nAfter a while, a luxuriously clad person entered with a golden staff and a book in his hand, “Is your new lord awake?” \\nhe asked one of the damsels.  The girl replied that their new lord had just woken up and that they were getting \\nready to celebrate his arrival in heaven by presenting the divine concert. “Let me make sure that all the preparations \\npertaining to his arrival have been  completed before you start the  concert, and let me also get some information \\nfrom him that the heavenly realm needs to know.” As he was saying this, he came to Rohineya.

He told her that she would give birth to a bright and charming child.  She felt very happy. \\nOne day a Jain Ächärya named Sinhgiri came to the city.  Both Dhangiri and Sunandä went to listen to his sermons \\nregularly.  Dhangiri’s soul was awakened by these sermons, and he lost interest in his wealth, family, and worldly \\naffairs.  He decided to give up his worldly life and become a monk.  He told his wife about his decision.   She was \\nshocked.  She tried to convince him to stay and enjoy their life together.  She also said that since they were going \\nto have a child, so it would be better to stay together to raise the child.  Dhangiri did not change his mind.  \\nNonetheless, he m ade the necessary financial arrangement for his family.  Sunandä, who was the daughter of a \\nreligious merchant, Dhanpäl, had a deep understanding of religion.  Therefore, she accepted his decision.  Sunandä \\nwas consoled that at least she was the wife of a virtuous man. \\nA few months later, Sunandä gave birth to a very handsome boy.  He was lovable because he always had a smile \\non his face.  Everybody who saw him liked him from the ir very first glance.  Sunandä celebrated his birth.  She felt \\nhappy that she had a son to raise, but her happiness did not last long.  One day some ladies from the neighborhood \\nwere visiting her and started talking about her husband.  One of them said, “If Dhangiri had not taken dikshä, then \\nhe would have celebrated the birth with m ore extravagance than Sunandä.” The child, although a baby, heard the \\nword “dikshä” and started thinking.  He felt as if he had heard the word dikshä before.  While thinking about it, he \\nsuddenly remembered his past life.  He realized that he was on the ri ght spiritual path.  He decided that he should \\ntake advantage of being born as a human again and utilize this life to further uplift his soul.  He should become a \\nmonk like his father.  He also realized that his mother would not let him go because he was h er only hope and joy.  \\nHe started thinking about what could be done to get her permission. \\nAt last, he came to the decision that since his mother would not let him go willingly, he should create a situation in \\nwhich she would get tired of him and give him up.  He was still a little boy in the crib when he thought, “If I keep \\ncrying all the time, she will get tired of me and maybe she will try to get rid of me.” He put his thoughts to work right \\naway.  He started crying.  His mother came running to comfort him, but he just kept crying.  She tried everything \\nThe baby kept crying and could not be comforted'),\n",

Although Muni \\nDhangiri did not understand what his guru meant, he left for alms.  On his route to various houses, he arrived at \\nSunandä’s house.  He said, “Dharma Läbha” (May you follow the proper religion).  Sunandä recognized the voice.  \\nShe welcomed Muni Dhangiri and expressed happiness in seeing him again.  She invited him to enter the house \\nfor food. \\nThe young boy also heard Muni Dhangiri’s words: “Dharma Läbha”.  He thought that this was the best opportunity \\nfor his trick, so he started crying.

He does not let me rest and I am \\nvery unhappy.  Please accept him so there will be peace in the house.” The child heard these words and became \\nvery happy in his mind.  He hoped that his father would accept her proposal.  Muni Dhangiri remembered the words \\nof his guru spoken right before he left for alms.  Now he understood what his guru meant.  He said, “Sunandä, if \\nyou really want to give this child away, I will accep t him, but please think twice.  Once you give him away, you will \\nnot be able to get him back.

The fact that the artists have \\ndone it in marble is marvelous, and draws the instantaneous admiration of every visitor.  These types of sculptures \\nare not found anywhere else in the world.  It is said that Vimalshä paid the artists in gold.  The artisans collected \\nthe marble dust that they had carved for the day and brought it in and had it weighed.  The person in charge would \\ngive them gold equal to the weight of stone powder! His generosity and the beauty of the temple have immortalized \\nhis name.  It is virtually a wonder of the world.

Both \\nof them were eager to have a son and went t o the temple \\nto express their wish.  While they were waiting for midnight \\nto arrive, they felt thirsty.  Vimalshä therefore went to an \\nadjoining well to fetch water.  Inside the well there were \\nsteps which went all the way down to the water level.  While \\nhe was going down the steps to get the water, someone \\nasked him to pay toll for taking water.  Vimalshä was \\namazed to hear that and asked the person why he was \\ndemanding toll to drink the water.  The person replied that \\nhe was a descendent of the person who  had built the well.  \\nSince he was poor, he was collecting a toll for using the \\nwell. \\nVimalshä was taken aback to hear that.  He asked himself, \\n“What would happen if one day some of my own \\ndescendants tried to collect a toll for the temple that I have \\nbuilt?” He shuddered at the idea and again asked himself \\nwhether it would be better in that case to remain without a \\nchild.  He went up and told his wife about the incident.  She \\nconcurred with his thinking.  At midnight when the goddess \\nasked them what they wanted, Shridevi replied that she did \\nnot want a child anymore.  Now, it was the turn of the \\ngoddess to be taken aback at the reply.  Vimalshä narrated what he had experienced and said that they wanted to \\nremain childless. \\nVastupäl and Tejpäl \\nTwo brothers, Vastupäl and Tejpäl, were min isters in the court of King Vir Dhavala in Gujarat.  Tejpäl was also a \\nvery outstanding commander of the army.  Both brothers made their name by their valor and faithfulness.  They \\nhelped the King to conquer enemies and maintain law and order in the kingdom.  Tejpäl’s wife, Anupamä devi, was \\na wise and smart woman who always helped her husband in family matters.  She was sweet spoken and a very \\nreligious and compassionate woman. \\nTejpäl had always respected her opinion.  Once, th e families of both the brothers and many others went on a \\npilgrimage.  They came to a small village.  This particular area was not regarded as very safe for the pilgrims \\nbecause the road was frequented with burglars.  Thinking that they might meet some bur glars on the way, the \\nbrothers decided to bury and hide their wealth in a nearby area.  They started digging a hole, but to their amazement, \\nthey unearthed a big pot of jewels and coins from the ground.  They simply did not know what to do with this wealth. \\nTejpäl asked Anupamä devi what they should do with this immense wealth.

Since Karnävati was a fast growing city, Udayan decided to move there.  He did not know anyone there \\nso he first went to the local Jain temple.

As she knew the newcomers were Jains, she took them home and treated \\nthem as her guests for a couple of days.  Then she gave them an old house for shelter.  Udayan settled there and \\nstarted a small business.  Luck favored him and within a short time he earned and saved enough to renovate the \\nold house.  While digging the ground, he came across a hidden treasure.  Since he was honest, he took the treasure \\nto Lachchhi and offered it to her because it belonged to her.  She declined to accept it, stating that since the property \\nhad been given to him, the treasure also belonged to him. \\nUdayan now had enough money to start a large-scale business.  He made lots of money, and in due course became \\nthe wealthiest man in Karnävati.  The state also recognized his status and gave him the position of the first citizen \\nof Karnävati.  In that capacity, he rendered valuable service to the people of Karnävati. \\nAt that time, the city of Khambhät (about 80 miles from Amdäväd) was the most lucrative seaport on the western \\ncoast of India.  Politicians competed with one another to get the position of governor of that city.  Due to the proven \\ncapability of Udayan, he was appointed governor of Khambhät in 1120 A.D.  He held that position for a fairly long \\nperiod.  Two major events have been attributed to him during his tenure as governor.  \\n\\uf0b7 At the suggestion of the queen mother, Minaldevi, he abolished the pilgrim tax of Bholäd \\n\\uf0b7 He helped Devchandra suri to initiate a five-year old boy, Chängdev, who had the potential to shine as a \\ngreat sage.  (Later on Chängdev became the great Jain Ächärya Shri Hemchandra) \\nHis loyalty to the King was unquestionable.  He hesitated to help Kumärpäl, who was roaming from town to town \\nhiding from King Siddharäj.  However, when Kumärpäl came to Khambhät in search of shelter, Hemchandrächärya \\nadvised Udayan to help him.  Since Udayan highly r espected the Ächärya, he agreed to hide Kumärpäl in his \\nbasement.  Shortly thereafter, King Siddharäj died and Kumärpäl became King of Gujarat.  King Kumärpäl kept \\nUdayan in his position as governor of Khambhät and later brought him to Pätan (capital city of Gujarat) to work as \\nhis trusted advisor. \\nUdayan had not forgotten how religion had helped him during his bad times.  He therefore used his wealth and \\nposition to promote Jainism.  As a token of his devotion to the faith, he constructed several Jain temp les.  Three of \\nthem are recorded in Jain history.  One was the temple known as Udayanvihär in Karnävati, another was Udävasahi \\nin Dholkä (nearby town of Karnävati), and the third one whose name is not recorded was in Khambhät.  \\nDuring the latter part of Udayan’s life, Kumärpäl sent him to subdue Sumvar, a notorious bandit in the Saurashtra \\nregion.  In that mission, he had to pass through Pälitänä.  He decided to go on a pilgrimage to Shatrunjay hill.  To \\ncommemorate the pilgrimage, his statue has been erecte d on a camel’s back in a small temple on the way to the \\nmain complex on the hill.  That place is now mistakenly known as Päp Punya Ni Bäri (window of good and bad \\nkarma). \\nAt that time, there was a wooden temple on the hill.  While Udayan was worshipping there, he saw a mouse take a \\nlit wick in its mouth and roam about.  Udayan recovered the wick from the mouse, but he realized that the temple \\ncould have been set on fire by a mouse.  He, therefore, vowed to construct a new temple there. \\nHe succeeded in his expedition against Sumvar, but he was badly wounded in combat, and his death was imminent.  \\nOn his death bed he told his sons about his vow to reconstruc t a new temple on  Shatrunjay hill.

It is located near the town of Pälitänä, about 140 \\nmiles southwest of Amdäväd, Gujarat.  There are nine temple complexes on the hill.  They are popularly known as \\nnine Tuks.  One of them is Chaumukhaji Tuk, located on the peak of the hill.  Here is an interesting story of the \\nconstruction of the temple complex there. \\nDuring the latter part of the 16th century when King Akbar, the great Moghul King, was ruling over India, there was \\na businessman named Savchand Jerä m in the town of Vanthali in the Saurashtra region of the Gujarat state.  He \\nowned a very large business.  He had many ships that used to export goods to Indonesia and other countries.  \\nDuring these voyages, they would buy merchandise at one place and sell it at another for profit. \\nOnce a fleet of 12 ships set sail with valuable merchandise.  After selling all their goods at a foreign port, they \\nreturned with valuable foreign merchandise.  On the way back, the fleet encountered a heavy storm and had to wait \\non an island.  Meanwhile, monsoons set in and the fleet was stranded on the island for a couple of months.  When \\nthe ships did not come back for a long time, Savchand’s shipping agents made all possible efforts to locate them.  \\nSince they did not find any trace of the fleet, they reported to Savchand that the ships were lost.  \\nThis was a heavy loss to Savchand.  He had invested a significant amount of money on the voyage and was \\nexpecting a handsome return by selling the merchandise that the ships were expected to bring back.  With the loss \\nof his ships, he faced an acute shortage of funds and it was hard for him to pay back his creditors.  As the news \\nabout the lost ships spread, people started talking about how Savchand had lost everything and his creditors would \\nhave to write off their dues. \\nThat set off a panic among his creditors.  In order to realize their dues, they began to present their claims.  Savchand \\nwas a highly religious and honest person.  He tried to pay back his creditors as much as he could with the resources \\nhe had left.  One of the creditors was the prince of Mängrol, a place not far from Vanthali.  He had deposited 100,000 \\nRupees in Savchand’s firm.  That was a substantial amount because one Rupee of that time would be worth about \\nRs.  250 today. \\nWhen the prince learned about the loss of Savchand’s ships, he also became impatient and called for the repayment \\nof his deposit.  Savchand could not raise such a large amount so quickly.  He requested the prince to wait while he \\ntried to raise the money.  The prince, however, insisted on getting the amount immediately.  Savchand’s name and \\ncredit were at stake.  In order to maintain his credit, he had to find a way to pay the prince.  \\nAt that time, there was a businessman named Somchand Amichand in the city of Amdäväd.  Savchand did not have \\nany trade connection with him, but he had heard about Somchand’s firm and knew Somchand to be a very noble \\ngentleman.  An idea occurred to him.  He thought of satisfying the prince by gi ving him a promissory note which \\nwould be honored by Somchand’s firm.  The prince agreed to that form of payment.  Savchand wrote a promissory \\nnote payable to the prince by Somchand’s firm without Somchand’s permission.  Since he had no right to write this, \\nhe was overcome with sadness and guilt while preparing it and tears began to roll down his face.  A few tear drops \\nfell on the document and smeared the promissory note.  Then, with a heavy heart, Savchand handed the note to \\nthe prince and requested him to cash it with Somchand’s firm. \\nThe prince did not lose any time.  He immediately proceeded towards Amdäväd, and upon arriving presented the \\npromissory note to Somchand’s firm.  The accountant took the note in his hand and asked his men to look for \\nSavchand’s account.  The men searched their books, but they did not find any account in the name of Savchand.  \\nThe men reported that Savchand had no trade connections with their firm.  The accountant went to Somchand and \\ninformed him that he had received a promis sory note of exchange from Savchand of Vanthali which, being unduly \\ndrawn, could not be honored. \\nSomchand was puzzled to learn that.  He knew Savchand’s firm by name and was aware that it was a well reputed \\nbusiness organization of Vanthali.  He could not make out why Savchand would have drawn the note for such a \\nlarge amount when Somchand did not have any trade links with his firm.  He looked at the note again and noticed \\nthe letters smeared by Savchand’s tears.  He could make out from the water spots that  Savchand must have been \\nin a very embarrassing position and must have drawn the note out of sheer desperation.'),\n",

He, \\ntherefore, decided to oblige and asked the accountant to honor the note.  The accountant was confused and asked, \\n“From which account should the amount be debited?” Somchand instructed the accountant to debit it to his personal \\naccount. \\nThe note was accordingly accepted, and the amount was paid to the prince.  The prince did not actually need the \\nmoney and had asked for payment because of his doubt about the financial stability of Sav chand.  When the note \\nwas honored, he felt reassured about Savchand’s credibility and repented for insisting upon the return of his deposit.  \\nOn his way home, he went to Savchand and told him that he had received the amount from Amdäväd.

He has made \\npriceless contributions to Jain philosophy and literature.  He was a great philosopher, a brilliant poet, social reformer, \\na thinker, and a self-realized saint.  Mahatma Gandhi was highly influenced by Shrimad’s spiritual life.  Shrimad’s \\nwritings come from his experiences of life, and his teachings are widely followed by many Jain and Hindu aspirants \\nseeking spiritual awakening and self-realization. \\nBirth and Childhood \\nShrimad Räjchandra was born on the auspicious full -\\nmoon (Dev -Diwäli) of the month of Kärtik, 1924 V.S .  \\n(November 9, 1867) in Vävania , Morbi distric t, Gujarat.  \\nHis parents were Rav jibhai and Dev bä.  He was named \\nLaxminandan at birth, but after four years his name was \\nchanged to Raichand.  Later he became famous by the \\nname of Räjchandra. \\nRäjchandra’s father and grandfather followed the \\nVaishnav (Hindu) religion.  They were devotees of  Lord \\nKrishna.  His mother, Dev bä, was from a Jain family.  \\nThus, the child Räjchandra was brought up under the \\nunified culture of Jainism and Hinduism. \\nAs a child, Räjchandra was deeply interested in reading \\nvarious books.  Once he read the Jain pratikraman sutras \\nand was touched by the feelings of kindness to animals \\nand the expression of sincere forgiveness from each other \\nduring daily pratikraman rituals and the paryushan \\nfestival.  He was drawn closer to the Jain faith because of \\nthe emphasis it places on self -knowledge, self -control, \\npenance, renunciation, detachment from worldly affairs, \\nand meditation.  As a seeker of ultimate truth, Shrimad \\ncame to the conclusion that the philosophy and culture of \\nthe Jain religion was of the highest order of truth and \\nequanimity. \\nAn incident took place when he was seven years old that \\nchanged the course of his life.  An adult acquaintance, \\nShri Amichandbhai, died of a serpent -bite.  Young \\nRäjchandra asked his grandfather, “What does it mean to die?” His loving grandfather explained, “His soul  has left \\nthe body and he will no longer be able to eat, talk, or move.  His body will be burnt outside the village.” Räjchandra \\nsaw the dead body being burnt and slipped into deep contemplation.  Suddenly, as if a veil lifted, he recalled his \\npast lives.  With this experience he realized the pains of repeated births and deaths from one life to another.  This \\nincidence became a major spiritual awakening point in his life to free himself from the bondage of karma and the \\nlife cycle of pain and misery. \\nRäjchandra started his schooling at the age of seven.  With his exceptional ability to remember exactly what he saw \\nor heard or read once, he was able to complete the seven-year elementary school education in a mere two years.  \\nThe village school provided only s even years of education and hence his formal education came to an end.  \\nShrimad Räjchandra'),\n",

After his elementary education, he worked in his \\nfather’s shop and conducted the business honestly and sincerely.  \\nHe composed his first poem at the age of eight and started \\nwriting poems and articles related to social issues for \\npublication in the local newsletters.  Despite his young age \\nhe wrote serious articles on social reform subjects like the \\nneed for improving female  literacy rates, about child \\nmarriages, and about the display of wealth by the rich.  He \\nalso composed poems with nationalistic zeal. \\nAt a very young age, he had the supernatural ability to \\nforesee what was likely to happen and he helped people by \\nsaving them from possible disasters.  By the time he was \\n18, he had become a very proficient astrologer.  He was able \\nto identify books merely by touching them and know the \\ntaste of food without tasting it.  Along with developing all \\nthese extraordinary abilities,  he became very \\ncompassionate towards all living beings and  a strong \\npromoter of non-violence. \\nFamily \\nAt the age of 20  in 1988 A.D. , Räjchandra married \\nZabakben.  Zabakben was the daughter of Shri Popatlälbhai \\nJagjivandäs, the elder brother of Shri Reväshankarbhai who \\nlater became Shrimad’s business partner.  They had four \\nchildren.  Th eir two sons were Shri Chhaganlä l and Shri \\nRatiläl.  Their two daughters were Smt.  Javalben and Smt.  \\nKäshiben.  Shrimad had a younger brother named Shri \\nMansukhbhai. \\nShrimad Räjchandra became a partner in a gemstone business in Mumbai at the age of 20.  He was absolutely \\nethical, honest, and compassionate in all his business dealings.  In a very short time his business flourished because \\nof his wisdom and business insight.  His regard for truth, adherence to high moral values, and firmness to do what \\nwas right inspired many others.  In 1899 A.D., he totally retired from business at the age of 31.  \\nPower of Avadhän (Multi-Tasking) \\nAt the age of 17, Shrimad had observed someone performing eight different tasks simultaneously, known as Ashtä-\\nvadhäni, in Gujarati.  He studied the method, and the next day he was able to perform twelve tasks.  He soon \\nimproved his performance to be able to manage 52 avadhäns.  When he was 19, he w as invited to perform his \\navadhäns at a public meeting in Mumbai in the presence of the Bombay Chief Justice and other dignitaries.  He \\nsuccessfully performed 100 avadhäns, known as Shatävdhän. \\nThe 100 tasks included a variety of activities like playing cards, playing chess, counting the bell chimes, completing \\nmathematical calculations, composing poems with different themes and specified sets of words, and arranging the \\norder of words from 16 different languages which included English, Greek, Latin and Ara bic (note that Shrimad’s \\nformal study included only Gujarati up to Grade 7 of elementary school). \\nThis was an unbelievable feat, and the performance was given much publicity in all the major newspapers like the  \\n“Times of India” and “Pioneer”.  Shrimad was invited to go to Europe and demonstrate his extraordinary talents.  \\nThis would have meant more fame and substantial material gain.  However, he declined the offer because it would \\nbe extremely difficult to stay in Europe as per Jain religious standards.  He would also be distracted from his main \\nobjective of spiritual progress. \\nBy the time he was 20, his fame had spread throughout India, and he realized that he was achieving only material \\nbenefits for his amazin g powers, which was not what he wanted from his life.  He gave up all such activities \\nShrimad Räjchandra multi-tasking at \\nage 19'),\n",

True to its name, it deals with subjects that l ead towards the path of liberation.  It is written in a simple \\nand easy to understand language, but explains the Jain religion in the finest detail.  Its 108 lessons were composed \\nin three days! \\nÄtmasiddhi-shästra is an epic poem and the prime jewel composed by Shrimad in Gujarati in 1896 while he was in \\nNadiäd, a town near Amdäväd.  On one auspicious evening, he composed 142 stanzas of Ätmasiddhi-shästra in a \\nsitting of less than 90 minutes.  The fact that Shrimad composed such comprehensive and all-inclusive work within \\nsuch a short time can give us a clue of the depth of spiritual wealth he possessed.  \\nThe subject matter of Ätmasiddhi-shästra is the scientific characterization of the six fold truths of soul: its existence, \\nits eternity, doer of its karma, the impact of karma on it, the nature of the pure consciousness, and its potential for \\nattaining liberation from karma.  It describes the Jain philosophy comprehensi vely and also shows how \\nAnekäntaväda allows Jainism to encompass all other Indian faiths.  Many scholars have written an elegant \\ncommentary on the “Ätmasiddhi-shästra”. \\n“Apurva Avasar” was his last major compilation.  It is the most divine poem in which Shrimad expresses the fourteen \\nstages of spiritual progress for ultimate liberation.  Apurva Avasar was incorporated into the prayer book in \\nGandhiji’s Äshram. \\nThe complete works of S hrimad contain more than thirty -five poems and almost 950 letters which were written to \\nvarious people who came  in contact with him.  They are compiled in a text called “Vachanämrit”.  A high level of \\nspirituality is evident in his writings.  If one delves deeper into his literature, one will notice that his writings provide  \\nexcellent discourses for attaining self-realization leading to liberation. \\nMahatma Gandhi was very impressed by Shrimad’s spirituality and lifestyle.  He accepted Shrimad as his spiritual \\nguide with great respect and reverence.  When Gandhiji was in South Africa, he was under intense pressure fr om \\nhis Christian and Muslim friends to adopt their faith.  He wrote to Shrimad for guidance.  Shrimad’s guidance \\nconvinced him of how his own faith, Hinduism, would ensure his spiritual progress.  Gandhiji has written reverently \\nabout Shrimad in his autobi ography and has paid glorious tribute to him on several occasions.  He often revealed \\nthat he learnt compassion for all beings and non -violence from Shrimad.  According to him, Shrimad’s life and \\nspiritual writings impacted him more than Tolstoy and Ruskin. \\nSpiritual Progress \\nShrimad did not have a spiritual teacher in his life.  At the age of seven, when he was able to recall his past lives, \\nhe clearly remembered his association with Lord Mahävir in a previous life.  \\nIn 1891 A.D., at the age of 23, Shrimad realized samyag darshan.  He continued to enhance his progress by slowly \\ndetaching himself from the material world, deeply studying scriptures, strengthening virtues, refraining from worldly \\npleasures, and remaining in meditation for longer durations.  He started to stay at lonely places outside Mumbai for \\nmore than a month at a time.  In the beginning, there were many obstacles in his way because he needed to perform \\nhis duties as a house holder and as a businessman. \\nFrom 1896 A.D., he often spent several months in isolation in the woods of Uttarsandä , Idar, and Kavithä , where \\nhe would eat only one meal during the day and sleep very little.  He spent his time in deep meditation and attained \\na highly enlightened state of self-realization at the age of 28. \\nHe retired totally from business in 1899 at the age of 31 and requested that his mother permit him to renounce the \\nworldly life permanently and become a monk.  Unfortunately, his mother denied him out of love and affection.'),\n",

He was \\na native of Sailä, a town near Rajkot.  Based on his request, Shrimad composed the epic poem “Ätmasiddhi-\\nshästra” so that it would be easier to memorize.

He and Shrimad’s younger brother, Mansukhbhai, were responsible for recovering \\nShrimad’s letters and writings and publishing them.

He presented these teachings in simple \\nGujarati and Hindi in both prose and poetry forms.  As we stud y Shrimad’s writings in depth, we find that he made \\nan enormous effort to shed new light on true spirituality.  He succeeded in reforming blind faith with real spiritual \\nawakening. \\nHis biggest contribution is to point out the mistakes most people make in following a teacher based on the external \\nconduct and dress code.  The spiritual journey led by a wrong teacher leads the disciple to extended life cycles of \\nmisery and pain.  On the other hand, when an aspirant is able to know and follow the teachings of a  true teacher \\n(sadguru), he will be able to attain true freedom and liberation. \\nMorality: \\nGood manners, good activities, and good behavior are the roots of holiness.  \\nAll living beings are seen as equal.  Therefore, do not cause pain to any soul, nor extort  work from any soul \\nbeyond their ability and capacity. \\nHuman life: \\nAll living beings long for permanent happiness, and there is no exception to this.  This desire can be  \\nfulfilled only in a human life.  Yet human beings choose unhappiness.  This is due to his illusionary state \\n (Mohaniya karma - Mithyätva) in which he sees happiness in worldly desires and possessions.  \\nNon-attachment to Worldly Affairs (Vairägya): \\nDetachment from worldly and materialistic affairs and family relationships is defined as Vairägya, and \\nachieving it is essential for eternal happiness. \\nTrue renunciation is always followed by the true knowledge of the self or the soul.  Without true renunciation, \\na person will not be able to gain the true knowledge of the soul.  If one stops only at the stage of renunciation \\nand there is no desire for true knowledge, his/her human life would be in vain.  \\nKnowledge and Wisdom: \\nThrough proper knowledge, we are able to know the forms and qualities of the substances of the universe.  \\nThe Jain scripture, Uttarädhyayan Sutra, indicates that “Knowledge is like a needle with a thread.  Just like \\na needle with a thread in it does not get lost, a person with knowledge will not lose the right religious path in \\nthis world.” \\nIt is the true knowledge with which  an external feeling is controlled, attachment for life, family  and worldly \\npleasures is decreased, and the truth is revealed. \\nIf you know yourself, you know the whole world.  If you do not know yourself, your knowledge is worthless.'),\n",

The Columbus Hall of the Art Institute of Chicago was \\noverflowing with over 3, 000 delegates of different nations and religions.  It was the opening day of t he Parliament \\nof World Religions Conference, the first such conference ever organized in the history of mankind.  The aim of the \\nconference was to impart the knowledge of different religions to the world, to promote a feeling of fraternity between \\nfollowers of diverse religious persuasions, and to pave the way for world peace.  The conference lasted for 17 days. \\nTwo young men among them, with their Indian costumes and turbans, drew special attention from the public.  One \\nwas the world famous Swämi Vivekänanda, who represented Hinduism, and the other was Shri Virchand Räghavji \\nGandhi, who represented Jainism.  They made such an impact at the Parliament of Religions with their impressive \\nspeeches and personality  that, they both were requested to prolong their stay in the U.S.  and continue giving \\nspeeches in different cities after the conference was over. \\nShri Virchand Gandhi, a young man of twenty-nine, impressed the delegates not only by his eloquence, but also by \\nthe sheer weight of his scholarship.  The impartiality of his outlook and his oratorical skills fascinated the delegates \\nat the conference.  An American newspaper wrote, “Of all the Eastern scholars, it was this youth whose lectures on \\nJain faith and conduct were listened to with great interest and attention.” \\nShri Virchand R.  Gandhi was born on August 25, 1864 in Mahuvä, near Bhävnagar, Gujarat.  After his primary and \\nsecondary education in Bhävnagar, he joined Elphinstone College in Mumbai.  He graduated and obtained a B.A.  \\nDegree with honors from the University of Bombay in 1884.  He was probably the first graduate amongst the Jains \\nat that time.  He was also a student of Buddhism, Vedanta Philosophy, Yoga, Christianity and Western philosophy.  \\nHe had also done a comparative study of various philo sophies, which equipped him for talks on various subjects \\nwith confidence.  He had command over fourteen languages including Gujarati, Hindi, Bengali, English, Präkrit, \\nSanskrit, and French. \\nShri Gandhi became the first honorary secretary of the Jain Assoc iation of India in 1885 at the age of 21.  As \\nsecretary, he worked very hard for the abolition of the poll tax levied on pilgrims to Mount Shatrunjay, the most \\nsacred place of Jain religion at Pälitänä. To protest against the ruler .in those days was to invite severe punishment \\nand even death.  He prepared a case to compromise.  He made a strong representation to Lord Ray, the governor \\nof Bombay, and Colonel Watson, the political agent, and eventually the poll tax was abolished in place of a fixed \\npayment of Rs. 15,000 per year to the ruler for looking after the safety of the pilgrims and the holy place.  \\nIn 1891 Mr. Bod am, an Englishman, set up a factory for slaughtering pigs and maki ng tallow out of them at \\nSametshikhar, another holy place of Jain pilgrimage near Calcutta in the state of Bihar.  Shri Virchand Gandhi went \\nall the way to Calcutta to stop the killing of pigs at the holy place.  He stayed there for six months, learned Bengali, \\nprepared his case against the factory, and ultimately g ot this verdic t issued: “Samets hikhar is a place of Jain \\npilgrimage, and nobody else has any right to interfere there.” He got the factory to close down.  \\nShri Virchand Gandhi was a great social reformer at a very young age.  At the age of 22, he wrote long essays to \\nremove evil social customs and continuously fought against them and was successful in eradicating many of them. \\nShri Virchand Gandhi sailed to the U.S.  along with Swämi Vivekänanda to attend the Parliament of World Religion \\nConference in 1893.  He stayed in the United States for about two years after the conference and gave lectures in \\ncities such as Chicago, Boston, New York, and Washington.  He also visited England, France, Germany, and other \\nplaces in Europe.  In foreign countries, he wore a long and loose  kurta, a white shawl on his sh oulder, a golden \\nbordered kathiäwädi turban on his head, and country shoes.

On top of Mount Ratnasringa, there was a beautiful temple dedicated to Bhagawän Rishabhadev, \\nthe first Tirthankar.  Duri ng the month of Chaitra, on the day of the full moon, people came from far to visit and \\nworship at the temple.  Once,  King Hansa decided to visit the temple.  He asked his council of ministers to look \\nafter the kingdom during his prolonged absence and left  with members of the royal household on this spiritual \\nmission. \\nA few days after King Hansa departed, King Arjun attacked the city.  In spite of putting up a strong fight, King \\nHansa’s army was defeated, and many of the generals lost their lives on the bat tlefield.  King Arjun gained control \\nof the palace and the treasury.  King Arjun occupied the royal throne and enforced his authority over the entire \\nkingdom. \\nKing Hansa heard the story of thei r defeat on the way to the temple.  The King’s courtiers were very upset and \\nadvised him to return to the city.  The King said, “I have given up control of the kingdom and as we are on a spiritual \\nmission, that is what we should be thinking about.  So let us keep going to the temple.” The King’s courtiers were \\nunhappy about the King’s decision and worried about the safety of their families at home.  One by one, they all \\ndropped out until only one umbrella bearer remained with the King. \\nOn the way to the temple, they had to pass through the forest.  The King took off his royal dress and jewelry and \\ngave them to his servant.  While passing through the forest, the servant was separated from the King. \\nAs the King was walking, a deer ran in f ront of him and disappeared.  Right after that, a hunter came running with \\na bow in his hand and asked the King if he had seen the deer.  The King knew that if he told the truth, the deer \\nwould be killed.  He decided not to answer the question and instead kept talking about irrelevant things.  He said \\nthat he came from Räjpur.  The hunter asked him again about the deer, and he answered that he was the King.  \\nThe hunter was very upset with his answers and left in anger. \\nBy now, the King was tired and decided to rest under a tree.

Thoughts can even \\nlead the soul to liberation. You control your thoughts. \\nOutwardly, Prasannachandra was unperturbed, but inwardly, his mind was growing restless.  He visualized the \\nfrightened face of his young, helpless child and was mentally present at Pottanpur to protect his son.  Mentally, he \\nordered the army to be prepared for battle and saw his army carry out the order.  Even he came with arms onto the \\nbattlefield and wounded or imprisoned all who threatened to harm the well-being of his son. \\nThis agonizing state of mind full of violence and fear were contradictory to the peaceful outward nature that he was \\nmanifesting.  New thoughts were perpetually fueling the fire of wrath and vengeance burning within his mind.  \\nHowever, he heard the appreciative word s of a humble layman thanking him for his exemplary lifestyle.  \"Leaving \\nall worldly luxuries and practicing sädhanä is noble indeed\". \\nThe monk began to really think: Whose son?  Whose empire?  Of what am I thinking?  Why do these earthly cares \\nplague me so?  What good can come of wishing harm for others?  Such attachment is not wise.  I must repudiate \\nsuch inane feelings of victory and defeat.  Such are the thoughts of irrational men.  I wish to be beyond such trifles. \\nHis thoughts were now directed to the  proper idea.  Prasannachandra had pure thoughts and a new vision.  The \\nmental enemies disappeared.  The delusion was over.  The veils obscuring knowledge and perception were flung \\naside, thus clearing his path of all obstructions.  Prasannachandra attained omniscience. \\nWhen Prasannachandra was mentally doing battle before attaining omniscience, King Shrenik asked Bhagawän \\nMahävir “If monk Prasannachandra were to die right now, where would his soul go?” Bhagawän Mahävir replied, \\n“Oh, King! If Prasannachandra were to die now, then he would be reborn in the seventh hell!” The King was \\nsurprised by this answer.  He again asked the same question and Mahävir replied that if the monk were to die now, \\nthen he will reborn in the 12th heavenly region! \\nNow King Shrenik was very surprised by these answers, and soon he heard sounds of joy.  He asked Bhagawän \\nMahävir about these strange sound s, and Bhagawän Mahävir replied,” Oh King! The monk Prasannachandra has \\nattained omniscience! Then Bhagawän Mahävir explained to the King,” The first time you asked me where he would \\ngo, I replied that he will be reborn in the seventh hell because at that time, he was mentally fighting and killing an \\narmy.  Then he controlled his mind and was repenting for his bad contemplation caused by your minister, Durmukh.  \\nAt that time, you again asked me where he would be born if he died immediately, and I replied that he would be \\nborn in the 12th heaven.  Then the monk continued to purify his thoughts, and he eventually attain ed omniscience \\nand you heard the voices of celebrations! \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n31 - Questions: \\n1.  Why did King Prasanna become a monk? Whom did he entrust the kingdom to? \\n2.  What words did Durmukh taunt him with? What were the thoughts going through Prasannachandra’s mind on \\nhearing Durmukh’s words? \\n3.  When King Shrenik asked Bhagawän Mahävir where monk Prasannachandra’s soul go, why did Bhagawän \\nMahävir give a different answer both times? Why?'"

       "'VAJRAKUMÄR \\n \\n \\n JAIN STORY BOOK 119 \\n \\n33 - Vajrakumär \\nIn the city of Tumbivan, there lived a rich Brahmin named Dhangiri.  He had a beautiful wife named Sunandä.  Their \\nlife was full of joy.  When Sunandä was pregnant, she had a beautiful dream.  She told her husband, who was a \\nscholar, about the dream.  He told her that she would give birth to a bright and charming child.  She felt very happy. \\nOne day a Jain Ächärya named Sinhgiri came to the city.  Both Dhangiri and Sunandä went to listen to his sermons \\nregularly.  Dhangiri’s soul was awakened by these sermons, and he lost interest in his wealth, family, and worldly \\naffairs.  He decided to give up his worldly life and become a monk.  He told his wife about his decision.   She was \\nshocked.  She tried to convince him to stay and enjoy their life together.  She also said that since they were going \\nto have a child, so it would be better to stay together to raise the child.  Dhangiri did not change his mind.  \\nNonetheless, he m ade the necessary financial arrangement for his family.  Sunandä, who was the daughter of a \\nreligious merchant, Dhanpäl, had a deep understanding of religion.  Therefore, she accepted his decision.  Sunandä \\nwas consoled that at least she was the wife of a virtuous man. \\nA few months later, Sunandä gave birth to a very handsome boy.  He was lovable because he always had a smile \\non his face.  Everybody who saw him liked him from the ir very first glance.  Sunandä celebrated his birth.  She felt \\nhappy that she had a son to raise, but her happiness did not last long.  One day some ladies from the neighborhood \\nwere visiting her and started talking about her husband.  One of them said, “If Dhangiri had not taken dikshä, then \\nhe would have celebrated the birth with m ore extravagance than Sunandä.” The child, although a baby, heard the \\nword “dikshä” and started thinking.  He felt as if he had heard the word dikshä before.  While thinking about it, he \\nsuddenly remembered his past life.  He realized that he was on the ri ght spiritual path.  He decided that he should \\ntake advantage of being born as a human again and utilize this life to further uplift his soul.  He should become a \\nmonk like his father.  He also realized that his mother would not let him go because he was h er only hope and joy.  \\nHe started thinking about what could be done to get her permission. \\nAt last, he came to the decision that since his mother would not let him go willingly, he should create a situation in \\nwhich she would get tired of him and give him up.  He was still a little boy in the crib when he thought, “If I keep \\ncrying all the time, she will get tired of me and maybe she will try to get rid of me.” He put his thoughts to work right \\naway.  He started crying.  His mother came running to comfort him, but he just kept crying.  She tried everything \\nThe baby kept crying and could not be comforted'"
